SCRIPT

PART 1: The Great Extinction

NAR: You see, there was this garden.

NAR: And it was home to all the parts.

NAR: The part that makes decisions

DECIDER: More strawberries!

NAR: and the part that scouts the land,

SCOUT: (exiting the gate) There\'s something big coming.

NAR: and the part that guards the gate.

GATER: Sorry buddy, you\'re too young to go outside into the great
beyond.

NAR: I was just a wee child and there were more parts than my little
brain could remember

\<I\>Chatter Chatter\</i\>

NAR: This particular day, the grand council was discussing a vision for
the future.

WARN: We must dig down into the caves of yore and investigate the
rumbling sound. It\'s been getting louder-

HOPE: We must direct our focus on the skies, where the light still
shines.

DESPAIR: If we don\'t find more light soon, we won\'t be able to grow
anything.

CURI: We must seek help from the great beyond. We simply cannot face the
future alone

NAR: That\'s when my grandfather spoke up

G: I will speak now.

Nar: The room fell silent. The elders had been warning us for years, but
this was the first time that the great man himself spoke up

G: There is a time for hope, and reason, and careful planning. But not
today. I have seen what\'s coming from the great beyond, and it\'s not
something we can weather. We must leave the garden and find shelter if
we are to live and breathe another day.

NAR: For a moment, nobody dared to speak

NAR: Then all at once they started shouting

\<I\>SHOUTING. No! we can\'t do that. what about my strawberries? listen
to the old man. This can\'t be true. We\'ve weathered every storm!\</i\>

NAR: And suddenly the ground began to shake.

NAR: And dark clouds rolled in and blocked out all the light

NAR: And giant burning boulder started falling from the sky

\"Run!\"

\"But my strawberries!\"

\"Leave the strawberries!\"

\"My life\'s work!\"

NAR: In the blink of an eye, our whole world was torn apart. Our life\'s
work, evaporated in an instant

NAR: We tell this story every year, at the turning of the spring, as we
wait for Scouter to return and tell us if it\'s safe to leave the cave,
and start the garden up anew

Part 2: The Seeds Endure

*Scouter returns, with a handful of seeds.*

Part 3:
