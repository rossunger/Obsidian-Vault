[[Mary-Lou]] ran a tight ship. She wasn't harsh or anything, but she was efficient. She had to be. At the [[Curb & Door Warehouse]] they recieved 700 items an hour that needed to be identified, sorted, priced, and placed in the appropriate section. She had a crew of 25 people working round the clock collecting donations, and serving customers. It was a lucrative business, salvaging, but that's not why she did it. She hated to see perfectly good materials go to waste, and it warmed her heart to know that she was responsible for the repurposing of millions of objects.

As a child Mary-Lou had wanted to be an environementalist, but when she
realised that her family wouldn't be sending her to college, she turned to the next best thing. She supposed she could go now, but now it just seemed like "what's the point?"

For a few years Mary-Lou had searched for a co-captain to her salvaging
business and also a more stable romantic partner, but after a series of
mediocre experiences she had decided that it was a waste of time. She
still periodically brought home lovers to satisfy the physical urges, but it seemed more like a task to check off the list than a burning passion.

Mary-lou was at a point in her life where she had completed most of her
life's goals, and her life was mostly on auto-pilot. It was a strange feeling, and sometimes she wondered why she should get out of bed each morning. She had considered stocking up on [[Hero1]] and taking the highway outta this life, but had decided to give it a few more years, just in
case something interesting came up.

A knock on her door came 3 minutes earlier than expected.

MARY-LOU
Come in. Mr Lexler

[[LEXLER]]
Please, call me Lex

MARY-LOU 
You're early

LEXLAR
Would you like me to wait outside?

MARY-LOU
Normally, I would say yes, but I must say your message was very curious and you may consider my interest piqued. please explain yourself."

LEXLAR
As I was saying on the phone, your establishment is located inside
the last known vessel formally referred to as a [[ship]]. I have reason to
believe that there is a great flood coming that will wipe out the entire
city, and with a bit of preparation, your vessel may very well be the
future of the human race.

MARY-LOU
Mr Lexler, you have quite a sense of humour, which I appreciate, but
I'm wondering why you went to such great lengths to waste my time with
such nonsense. You must have called my secretary 17 times before she
even considered putting you on my agenda. What gives?

LEXLAR
Mary-Lou, may I call you that? I have spent the last 7 years trying
to devise a strategy that would save the human race from extinction, and
I am mortified to say that in all my simulations this is the closest I
have come to an outcome that doesn't involve immediate extinction in
the next 5 years

MARY-LOU: 
5 years? You must be joking

LEXLER
Please, just hear me out. Just look at my research.

MARY-LOU
Mr Lexler, even if your research were to have any inkling of truth,
this vessel hasn't been operational in hundreds of years, and if, as
you say, we have only 5 years to repair it, then in what universe is
this a viable solution?

LEXLER
In the universe where I have dug up the original schematics for
your ship. My 5 minutes are up, so I will leave you to your work, but
please just look it over and if you still think I'm crazy, I won't
bother you anymore. I promise. My number's on this card. I'll make
myself available if you decide to reach out.

Mary-lou's logic brain told her to throw the papers straight into the
trash, but something about this man tickled her curiosity and so she
resolved to glance at the papers during her evening break. Who knows,
maybe it would even be amusing. Like a sci-fi novel.
