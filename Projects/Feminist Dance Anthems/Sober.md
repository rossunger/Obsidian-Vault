I'm not an alcoholic
And it's not because I'm broke
It's not because I'm driving
And it's not because I'm woke
I just really like to feel present and alive
And I'm sick of all these social norms that make you ask me whyyyy...

I'm S s s s s s 
Sober, I'm here to dance tonight 
Sober, I'm here to make some friends
Sober, Cos it feels great to be
Sober

I don't wanna have to hide it,
Or pretend to sip on drinks
Or make up lame excuses
No I don't care what your friend here thinks
I'm sick of hearing stories of you vomiting or drunk
I'd rather hit the d-floor and get groovy wi' da funk

\[Funk break\]

I'm S s s s s s 
Sober, I'm here to dance tonight 
Sober, I'm here to make some friends
Sober, Cos it feels great to be
Sober

Quit trying to turn my water into wine
If you're trying to get me drunk please stop cos i ain't buyin'
I'm happy living life in my unaltered state of mind
And I don't need no substances to help me shine

I'm S s s s s s 
Sober, I'm here to dance tonight 
Sober, I'm here to make some friends
Sober, Cos it feels great to be
Sober

INITIAL IDEAS:
It's not safe for me to drink
I used to drink it brought chaos into my life
And i had to stop, and i feel so much happier now\...
I'm sorry you're uncomfortable with my sober state of mind
I don't feel the need to override my brain
Please don't try to buy me drinks
Make excuses, "Im getting up early" or "something about kids"
"It's just tonight" "I'm normally a party animals...
You feel like something's wrong with me if I don't want to drink
It makes you uncomfortable if I'm sober
I don't miss it, and that's okay\...it's just how I go about my day
Something about Drinking games
You find it Weird that I'm having a good time sober\...
Looking after people who are puking, or incoherent,
Mean drunks
Quit trying to turn my water into wine / i liked it just fine
It feels like you're trying to get me drunk, and that's kinda fucked up
And yeah, I like the sunrise, but waking up to it, not going to sleep...
My day doesn't start at 5pm
What's up with our culture that we need to override our brains,
\...is only possible when you're drunk
Medicate on hops
Something about needing to Forget
That joy is only possible in an altered state of mind
