Just cos I look white, cis, het, or mono
Don't give you the right to call me out say no-no
Cos looks can be deceiving, so you best not chide me
Cos you don't really know what's going on inside me

Validate me validate me
Make out like I'm parking and validate me
Tell me that I'm welcome
Tell me I belong
Tell me all those laterally violent folks were wrong

Validate me validate me
Treat me like a new account, and validate me

Just myy life seems far too normal
Just cos I wear mainstream clothes and drink chai lattes / ma face, high
praise,

Doesn't mean I'm basic


Validate me validate me
Make out like I'm data and validate me

Validate me validate me
Treat me like I'm human and validate me

Sure, you could split us into apples and pears
But doesn't that just feel like splitting hairs?
Let's all be fruit

Validate me

If my joke falls in a forest and no ones there to hear it, validate me
If I say I'm queer, but look like nothing near it, validate me

I want you to see me, for all of who I am\
don't take away my right to belong\
it looks like I don't belong\
Doors are closed to me\
Me showing up to pride holding a man's hand\
phenotype (bi vs straight, cis vs trans)\
coming out to parents\
I'm not just experimenting\
It's not just phase\
self-doubt

Just cos I look white or cis or het

Doesn't mean I am, and that I don't get it
