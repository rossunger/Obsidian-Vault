You 've been fed all these lies
Your fear has been normalised
You are not the only one, and you are justified
Your pain is real, and what they've done is nooooooot okaaaaaay

Iiiiiiii believe you. Iiiiiiii believe you. Iiiiiiii believe you.
And you don't have to justify yourself to me

You 've been through an ordeal
You don't have to reveal
The details of what you've been through, it's hard enough without that
I just want to say that I am here for you

Iiiiiiii believe you. Iiiiiiii believe you. Iiiiiiii believe you.
And you don't have to justify yourself to me
