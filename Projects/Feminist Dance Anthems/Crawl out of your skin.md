*(by Laura Gallant)*

Screaming in the middle of the night
wondering if you'll ever get it right
no wonder you're frustrated
you're over complicating it
Banging your head up against the wall
acting like it doesn't hurt at all
you're waiting for a saviour
but only you can save ya
But sister you will be alright
everything you need's inside
i'll help you crawl out of your skin
see your beauty once again,
get you outside, of your disguise
and if you fall back down again
I'll be there to lend a hand
be your guide
I'll follow you into the night
Grieving in the middle of the street
all the things you hoped you'd ever be
your fears just over taking
all that you've been making
but sister don't forget your drive
everything you needs inside
I'll help you crawl out of your skin..x2
