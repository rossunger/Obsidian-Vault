Tension and release
A mighty penchant for your dis-ease
Story arcs of suffering find
hearty homes in those who seek peace
Doing as you please,
Constructed like a cryptic crossword in a foreign tongue, deciphering mixed messages
Exhausted from this perfectly preposterous
psuedo-parasitic hyper-analytic never ending
high-stakes friend or long-lost-lover heart and mind trip,
where we're burning, slowly bonding,
turning over past mistakes,
examining absurdly all the unexpected cuts and breaks 
that crept into a crypt of critical but crumbled doorways,
crumpled letters to a younger self lamenting loss of all the lives you could have once lived
Torturing yourself for all the unknown choices that you made while still a wee kid
Recycling old stories with a new twist
Withering away despite a horde of bright gifts
Punishing yourself each time the fading light shifts
Pushing us away until we're trapped in tight slits, into
Gargantuan entanglements
With broken brains and mangled tents
And passengers defenestrating
Sacred things we'd venerated
Can't lock doors with tuck-taped windows
Can't butt horns with rock and splinters
Can't break bread with hostile victims
Can't repair decaying systems
