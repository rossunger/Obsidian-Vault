#### Lookisms
Repeat after me:
I'm sick of life feeling like a popularity contest
I refuse to make decisions based on how you look
I commit to fight my bias
ever notice how \_\_\_, that's messed up

"the best way to make big social change is to become famous"
"there's certain clothes you just don't wear"
"it sends the wrong message"
"what you wear defines who you are"
"Society keeps telling us how we have to look"

Lookism is discriminatory treatment toward people considered physically
unattractive, mainly in the workplace but also in dating and other
social settings.

media makes a certain "look" feel familiar

popularity
-   Biases
-   Drawn to people that we find attractive
-   Something about face-tuning apps!
-   Pimples, veins, bags under your eyes, birthmarks, pores

What do you love/hate about the way that you look that you wish could be
celebrated / seen as beautiful?
-   The profile of my face and my goofy teeth!
-   My lazy eye. Love it but also hate it. But just wish people would
    stop pointing it out

#### Expectations
A song about how people expect things from you based on the way you look
or sound
I'm gonna challenge my expectations
I want No more expectations
Cliche interpretations
No subtle reservations
Based on on my social station

#### Name It
If you're feeling off, and you could use some help,
Just Name it

If you're feeling mad, and wanna let off steam,
Just Name it

If you're feeling anxious, and you need some space to breathe
Just Name it

If your friend cracks a joke and it makes you squirm,
Name it

If you feel like a turd, and can't find the words,
Just name it

If you're feeling
If you're not sure what you're feeling
Just say that

Cos chances are there's someone else who's feeling that way too(?)

Step one, say what happened, in the least judgemental way you can
Step two, share your feelings, try to focus on how it feels and not why
Step three, self reflecting, what's the story you're telling yourself
about why you feel like this
Step four, ask for help without expecting anything in return

An example:
Hey, you just told a joke and there's something now that I want to
share
I feel anxious, and wary, and there's a growing tension or pain in my
chest
And the story that I'm telling myself is that you don't care how I
feel and I know that's not true
And I'm wondering, if you're willing to consider who was the butt of
your joke

#### You're Perfect
Hey. Listen. I've got something to say
I know you're struggling to find your way
Wondering if you're good enough or smart enough, or strong enough,

I see it in you every day
But im here to tell you

Its not about the things you've done
Its not about the wars you've won
It's not about us having fun
You're perfect. I love you. Just the way you are

I hate when people tell me "THIS is someone you should meet"
As if they're special and more worthy of my attention
A person is a person, not because they tick a box

Compliments are a judgment
I wanna live in a world where I'm valued just for being me
And not because I add value to your life

you don't need to be the best, or the loudest, or the smartest, or
fastest
if we all stop trying to be the best alone, we'll be so much better
together

#### Body Parts and Gender
From the day that I was born and you first
Saw between my legs you started
Calling me by "he" and it changed the
Way you treated me
And every time I tried to be
A way that you thought of as "she"
You put me back into my box
Now I'm a walking paradox

**\[CHORUS\]**

Cos body parts and gender
Are separate things, and they're tender
They don't belong in your blender
Where you smoosh them up, and cut them down, and make them into this
awful goo

Cos body parts and gender
Are a private thing, they feel tender
And I hope that you can surrender
Cos if you really love me we'll make it work, and you don't have to be a
transphobic jerk

Well my identity is queer
But I internalised your smears
And I can see it will take years
To set me free from all my fears
Yeah, the transphobia is deep
Ingrained, and therapy ain't cheap
And I keep censoring myself
And it's just awful for my health

Cos body parts and gender
Are a touchy subject, they're tender
/ offend 'er, surrender, pretender, suspender, defend 'er, blender, lend
'er, tender


#### Talking 'bout My Period
I like talking about my period
I like talking about how weird it is
All the feelings all the pain
How I'll never live in shame
Cos I like talking 'bout my period

teaches you to ask for help\...lean on other... take rest for yourself
helps get in touch with emotions... be good with boundaries\...
syncing up
day one is the worst, no day 2's the worst
pms is the worst part
in the winter I always have a mental breakdown the day before my period
I wanna complain about my cramps
It's a special connection with all us menstruating folks
Thank god, I'm not pregnant -is this insensitive?
irregular
breakdown: diva cups, pads, tampons, tylenol, heating pads, chocolate.
luxury tax... they should be free!
not all women bleed, and some men do

A board game about periods
-   Syncing up with the moon cycle
-   Random pain cards... cramps, psychological, emotional, problematic
    loved ones.
-   Random patriarchy cards that get in your way
-   Painkiller cards, hot water bottles, moon time tea, drugs,
    meditation,
-   Each \"square is a blob of blood\"
-   Something about rolling the dice
-   Can take birth control to avoid period things, but risk nasty side
    effects
-   Something about Pregnancy?
-   Something about having a job and having to work while in pain
-   Something about tampons/pads/diva cup... something about luxury item
    tax
-   Something about painting with blood
-   Something about puberty... maybe you get to go around the board once
    or twice before you start having periods
-   Blood sand timer
-   Reusable cloth
-   Uterus V shaped board

#### Rules Are Made To Be Broken
A song about how we're programmed to do as we're told... especially as
children...

"You want us to be free thinkers, you want us to improve the world...
but on your own terms... but if we're gonna be free thinkers we're gonna
end up challenging you\".

you want me to think for myself

either way the programming stays the same

daddy or john or both

you both want me to do as im told

well, good thing daddys programming is gold

the golden rule s'always meant to be broken

that's why they're put in place

and it's up to each person

to draw the moral from the page

im not getting lost in my antics

im here to shake up this place

because your programming is old now

im updating what's out of date

rules:

be good be good be good

be quiet, be pretty, be still, stay clean

be on your best behaviour

we want to look at you before you're obscene

eyes to yourself

don't be too.... needy, emotional, much, big, loud, passionate,

be a good girl

do as your told

make others happy

and your heart will be gold

why do you get to decide

what good or bad looks like

my obscenity is my pride

robots.... doing as were told

thou shalt not

#### Climate Action Warriors

A song about how children are fighting a climate war...
We're climate action warriors
We're fighting for our lives
We're climate action Warriors

...
Fighting for the future of the human race
Children shouldn't have to fight a war
But here we are.

Knocking it out of the park
Our weapons are our words
Viral videos are tanks

Tweeting truth bombs left and centre
Protests, schools strikes, hunger strikes, sailing across ocean,
boycotts,
Politicians pants on fire / liar
Can't fight floods with bullets
Can't fight heat waves with \_
Can't fight droughts with fire
Nor rising seas with \_\_

And gas masks won't protect you from the damage caused by carbon /
green house
Future generations / civilization
I didn't sign up for this, but circumstance make conscripts of us all
Front lines, battalions\
Battles, campaigns,

Bullets, guns, shields, armour,
Navy, army, airforce
Reinforcements
Crossfire,
Borders
patrol,
Tsunamies/Storms washing away shorelines / border / \[things\]...
Gas, mushroom cloud, nuclear bombs, gas masks
Conscripts, open call for soldiers
New recruits
Boot camp
Drills
Sergeants, captains, generals, commanders lieutenants, privates,
admirals, corporals, rank, Uniform, chevron, flags,
PTSD
Strategy, maps, battleships, cruisers, submarines, torpedoes,
Justice, freedom fighters, terrorists,
Funeral, lost at sea, MIA, AWOL, gurney, infirmary, memorial,
Transmission lost , SOS, sonar,
Carnage,
Helicopters, jets,
Discharge,
Prisoners of war
Intel, top secret, spy, under oath, life or death, double agent,
Canon fodder,
Following orders, Chain of command, insubordination
Behind enemy lines, The call of duty, post, on base,
Something about action figurines

#### Set Myself Free

A song about self worth, and not letting people's expectations of you
limit who you are

I'm gonna set myself free

#Bird imagery - fly, free fall, glide, spread my wings, fly the coop,
leave the nest, wild, wingspan, hatching egg, incubating

#mountain/landscape imagery = dreams, obstacles, potential, peak,
horizon, across oceans that seemed to vast to cross

#captivity imagery - cages, chains, captivity, servitude, glass ceiling,

#horse imagery too? Or is that too much? Galloping across open fields,
hair blowing in the wind,

#you start as a horse and become a bird, or a pegasus?

#horse sprouts wings

#maybe call the song Pegasus?

#duet with a horse and bird? Joining to become one - a pegasus? Or a
horse sprouting wings? Or a horse becoming a bird

I love that I'm wild and wicked,

I don't wanna be tame

#### Family Matter

A song about the ethics of having children

#hard to justify having kids... overpopulation, climate change, what
world are you leaving them

#but it's so important to raise the children of tomorrow in a good way

#problematic to control people's reproduction...

#how do we celebrate people wanting to have kids?

#how do we support parents?

#It takes a village to raise a child


#### Corporate Laundry List
Our laundry's clean, stop washing it.
you're making me feel dirty
you're wearing me thin
You're making it monotonous / a monotone
you're actions are tonedeaf
quit rinsing my identity
stripped it of it;s color 
bleached it of it's grit

your help's all Smoke and mirrors,
you're lilac hues won't pass for purple
your pale dogwood/ cotton candy won't pass for pink
your khaki \_\_ won't pass for green
perwinkle or navy won't pass for blue.
your cream wont pass for white
i know your words bite
My identity is not for sale

Greenwashing
Pinkwashing / Rainbow washing
Brown washing
Whitewashing
Bluewashing
Purplewashing
Redwashing
Sexywashing

Making trinkets and souvenirs saps a revolution of its power... makes it
a joke

I can do my own laundry

stains
dull colors

you've made it all the same colour (like when you accidentally put a
red sock in the laundry and it turns it all one colour).
capitalism is like the red sock
color bleed
a laundry list of corporate crimes

#### Yonic Pride
We've talked enough about the phallus
Now i wanna take a break /awake, mistake, bake, cake, fake, flake,
snake, shake, make, goodness sake
something Scrotal
Having balls don't make you brave /save, fave, rave, wave, shave, slave
Let's Yoni-fy this town
My Yonis

labial
seminal
ovarian

People pleasers

Mumble rap about how hard it is to be clear about boundaries


I Want To Choose

(Anna jacobs and Michael xxxxxxx)

An angel, a princess, that's what I used to be

Cos I was ashamed of myself and my anatomy

A demon a monster a goddess born again

But angels and demons are sides of the same coin flipped by men

And I want to choose the coins that I'm flipping

And I want to choose the face that I wear

And I want to choose what to do with my body

If I'm willing or able to share

A good girl a bad girl

A girl whose in between

A hot girl a girl plain as can be

A girl who's never seen an insult a label a catcall from a guy

An internet rumour, a sink piece, a gossip, a fucking lie

But I want to choose the life that I'm living

I want to choose how much space that I take

I want to choose what to do with my body

When to move forward and when to break

And I want to choose the road that road that I'm taking

I want to choose how far I will go

I want to choose who is riding beside me

I want to choose what's playing on my radio

So step into the power of your choosing

step into the power of your body (stand proudly so no one can shame it)

Power you can weild without abusing (I hold up my hand I hold up my
power

The power of accepting or refusing

We get to choose the crap we'll put up with

We get to choose our lines in the sand

We get to choose the future before us

We get to choose where we will ???

Rising daughter setting sun

Rising daughter setting sun

Rising daughter setting sun
