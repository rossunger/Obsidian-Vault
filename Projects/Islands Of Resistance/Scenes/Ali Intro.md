[[Ali]] was a nervous type. They knew what they wanted, but they were always
scared they were making the wrong decision. In an act of
uncharacteristic confidence they had decided to meet an online stranger
in real life, which led them to an underground queer club called [[The Quinn]]. They had heard about such places, but had always been too scared
to try to find one for fear of undercover gender pigs.

As they lay on this table in a strangers house, they found themselves
struggling to recall the events that brought them here. Theyd been
drinking at the bar, and then they were talking to a dancer named Trist
and then... They couldnt quite remember what then.

Ali noticed two people staying at them and realised they were waiting
for a response. "Where am I?"

"Do you remember what happened?"

"No"

"Do you remember who I am?"

"Yeh"

To be truthful, Ali did not remember who this was, but was lacking the
confidence to be honest in this moment. Thankfully, this kind stranger
seemed to see right through them and filled in the blanks

"We met in the bathrooms. You seemed anxious about something but you
wouldnt say what, and I offered to walk you home? You dont remember
do you?"

"Is this my blood?"

"Yes"

"What happened?"

"oh boy."
