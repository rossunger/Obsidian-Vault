-   There's no wrong answer

-   Right now?

-   Live gives you what you need not what you want

-   Accept what is

-   Other people's actions are not responsible for your feelings

-   Build trust slowly

-   It's a gift

-   Whoever shows up is the right people to be there

-   Life is beautiful even when it hurts

-   Life gives you just as much as you can take

-   Words are spells

-   You don't have to defend yourself

-   I'm prepared to let that one go.

-   My shit is my shit

-   This too shall pass

-   Do you

-   I am the most powerful witch I know (When it come to matters of
    > me\...i.e nobody can curse me in a way that I can't undo or
    > overpower)
