![[Defibrillate.m4a]]
De-fibrillate my fibrous vessels and let the
tessellated Western sediments
re-surge as restless testaments to
how much work is still ahead of us
enormous burnt impediments
descend on us where residents
break bank to live in tenements
where Denizens of venison
In designated garrisons
Accommodate unconsciously
Gesticulating warning signs
Foregoing Golden cortisols
For sentimental goings-ons

And embryonic pensioners
Accumulate attention spans
Through patented technologies
That are forged in ideologies
Who divisively and Decisively
distort the worlds they pride themselves on

Fermenting their foreign sanctuaries
Tormenting their forlorn actuaries
Perpetuating classroom mortuaries 
Buried in their endless tortured stories 
Burning bridges where they see no glory
Ashes where there should be mores

Destitute, I obsess with you,
over pesticides, in the country side,
where the best us, played the festivals,
where the guests of ours, were intensified,
by the words we said, and the prose we read,
And the harmonies that we cultivated,
And the Vortices that we propagated
All the Pleasantries that we escalated
Delegating 
serenading
Elevating 
promenading
