[[Vero]] couldn't stand the city. Everything about it felt alien and cold.
It was ironic that they had spent the better part of their life
desperately trying to get into the city, and now that they were here,
all they could think about was getting out. At first it had seemed
impossible, but after a bit of digging they discovered that there was a
secret expedition that periodically headed out. Vero had made it their
mission to become a part of this team, but having been on a few outings,
realised that it wasn\'t enough. A few weeks a year? What kind of life
is that? That\'s when their friend put Vero onto the idea of being a
refugee liason. It wasn't a job that existed yet, but there was a team
working on pitching it to the government who were struggling to find
someone willing to spend so much time away from the city.

As Vero sat in Charlie\'s office they wondered whether this was a trap.
They has heard wild stories about government agents framing and
entrapping new refugees who were believed to be undesirable or
inflammatory. Vero didn\'t consider themselves inflammatory. They kept
their opinions to themselves, and didn\'t bother anyone. But you could
never be sure.
