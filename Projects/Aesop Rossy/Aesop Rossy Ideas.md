Please let this be a time for pastimes 
let it not be crime to cast lines
Desperate seeking fast signs
Praying this to be the last time




  
Gallivanting salamanders gratifying ex-commanders
Testifying _ glampers
SatisfyingÂ 

  
  
  

There's a golden path of balance and I keep tryin'a walk it
But it's hidden from view and it twist and turns without warning
Though you know when you're on it, you can't always see it's directions
With it's higher dimensions, good luck making conscious corrections

I keep following breadcrumbs only to falter and stumble
Then I sit and I wait and I pray for the strength to be humble.
In the stillness of silence I might have a chance still to find it
Then I blink and I sneeze and in a moment of faith I'm inside it
  
Spirits help me find that Golden path
Help me walk in balance and relax
Grant me wisdom clear enough to see it
Grant me patience long enough to be it
Grant me perseverance strong enough to reach it




  
What I've learned from phones about lovers
Is that you can't unbreak a broken screen
You could replace it with another
But the price is far too steep
You can't unsay a tone that's harsh
You can't unhurt a wounded heart
You can't unblurt out false retorts
You can't undoom what's torn apart

  

You only get one strike, don't blow it

Even a case will not protect them
From a drop at certain heights

Charge them frequently, and fully
(And update software when you can?)
