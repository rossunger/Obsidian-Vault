LIFE DOULA + CEREMONY HOLDER

I will be there to help you grieve, love, rage, and celebrate all the
experiences that life doesn't quite prepare you for

When you might need me:

-   You're going through a breakup, or beginning a new relationship

-   Birth, Death, or impending death of a loved one

-   You get a new job, or lose a job that was important to you

-   A close friend moves away or no longer has time for you

-   A conflict in your community is isolating you from your support
    > networks

-   You have a difficult choice to make and you need more than just
    > logical advice

-   Life is feeling mundane or you've lost connection with your
    > spiritual side

-   Something good happens and you feel overwhelmed by feelings

The stories we tell ourselves shape how we live our lives, and sometimes
we need outside help to reshape our narratives, and let go of the ones
that are no longer serving us.

I view Ceremony as the act of holding space for yourself and your
community to go inward and reconnect with the parts of you that are
deeper than the logic brain. Only by moving beyond the logic brain can
we see what stories we've REALLY been telling ourselves, and begin to
rewrite them.

"What does a ceremony look like?" You might ask. Every ceremony is
different, but you can expect various forms of meditation, sharing of
gratitudes, intention setting, asking for help, letting things rise to
the surface, subconscious imagery work, chanting and music, other energy
work, and much more. The kinds of help we need are so specific and
varied that you can't just have a cookie-cutter ceremony.

I have a deep background in the arts, especially music, improvisation,
and performance, and it is a core influence of how I run ceremonies.
Intuition is my most powerful guide. In seeking healing myself, I have
been working with medicines from the south, and medicines from the
north, and tapping into my siberian roots and working with a variety of
shamanic traditions, and I intend to eventually bring these traditions
into my own ceremonies once I have enough experience and understanding
to do so in a respectful way.

Ceremonies might help you:

-   Feel a connection to your spirituality

-   Feel a connection to your community

-   Face various trauma and trauma-adjacent issues that you've been
    > living with

-   Feel joy without being afraid of losing it

-   Feel more centred, grounded, and present with what's happening in
    > your life

-   Understand your feelings and experiences.
