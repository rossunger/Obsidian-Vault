*(Lyrics by Beaky Maclean and Ross Unger)*

Where do I begin and end
And how am I to comprehend
When you and I are blobs of goo
And I'm both me and really parts of you

I am me and you are you
And together we make something new
I am me and you are you
And together we make something new

Where's the objective line
between my body and mind
And how am I supposed to tell the difference
Where's the subjective line
Between your body and mine
And how do I begin to tell the difference

You and I venn-diagram it
But things don't go quite as you plan it
And something triggers us, and damn it
I cut you out, My walls shoot up like piles of granite

I am me and you are you
And together we make something new
I am me and you are you
And together we make something new

Inviting you inside my threshold
Make me wonder how our mesh folds
Sometimes it feels nice and rosy
But then our goo starts getting cozy

We're terrified to be dismembered
It gets so hard just to remember that

I am me and you are you
And together we make something new

It can be hard to know, if this is what I want

"I want more than the story that I'm letting this become"

Where's the objective line between my mind and body

Where's the objective line between your eyes and my body

What's this subjective line between my

Make a Venn diagram with me


"Boundaries are the distance at which I can love you and me
simultaneously"
