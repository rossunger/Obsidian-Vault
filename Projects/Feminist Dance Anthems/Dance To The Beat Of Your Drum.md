If you can move your feet then move your feet,
If you can shake your head, then shake your head
And if your heart beats on then you can beat your heart\

And you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum
And you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum
And you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum

We've all got baggage, and we're all a little stressed,
We're all a little broken, and we're doing our best,
So when we come out here to let it all hang low,
God, I feel it in my heart that its ok to let go

So let's hold spaaaaace.
And let's build trust.
Yeah it takes time,
But it's what we gotta do

If there's no room for you then you can't fit in
It's not your fault, you're perfect, just keep lookin'
Yeah somewhere out there there's a you shaped hole

Where you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum
yeah you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum
yeah you can dance dance dance to the beat of your drum

There's no right way and forget about normal,
This life is not a test, it ain't your high school formal,
And no one's really watching, but we feel you're here
God, I feel it in my heart that its ok to let go

So let's hold spaaaaace.
And let's build trust.
Yeah it takes time,
But it's what we gotta do
