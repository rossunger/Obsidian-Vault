[[Yurigama]] was a shape-shifter. The slippery kind. From a very young age
they had developed a proclivity for folding themselves into whatever was
needed in the moment to avoid a tyrannical tirade masquerading as
conversation which their parents perpetually insisted on delivering any
time something deviated from their expected trajectory. Humour was the
first line of defence, but as their civil union began to dissolve, Yurigama had learned to support their parents with the "shoulder-to-cry-on" technique. 
Despite being profoundly inappropriate for child-parent relationship, it was unfortunately band-aid enough to get them through the hardest times. Beyond that, they had learned the "agree-with-everything" technique, and the "keep-your-mouth-shut" technique, and "vague-non-committal-phrases" technique, and many other subtle manipulations to maintain peace and balance in their interactions with other.

After the separation, Yurigama found themselves torn between two worlds,
the elite upper-middle level of their mother's birthright, and the grungy, blackout-line-teetering lineage of their father. They found themselves riding the elevator regularly, which for a child is unheard of, and it is here that they really learned the meat and potatoes of fitting in. People underestimate the extent to which children listen. Sometimes Yurigama would become so engrossed in their observations, that they would get off on the wrong floor and follow people around until someone caught them and took them back to the elevator.

Now that they were an adult, Yurigama's skillset had become a problem.
They were so good at adapting and becoming other people that they had
lost their sense of self. Their closest relationships often broke down because how can you trust someone who is constantly becoming a different person? It didn't help that they were working for the secret police, but of course, nobody knew about that.
