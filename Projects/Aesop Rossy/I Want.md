I want to live in a world where they put me on grand pianos
to play into physical realms the things that are felt but unspoken,

I want to be held and adored, and my ears to hear whispered "I know"s
As I cry out the pains of the lifetimes of shame
Borne by ancestors who believed they were broken

I want to encounter often, and freely,
the people that light up my soul and inspire me
Who will fan all the flames of my joys and creations,
And say thank you to all our relations
 
I want the crushes that do not hurt, and the lovers that do not break, and the partners that stay the course, and communities that do not falter
 
I want to take up my altar,
And share my gifts with the seekers,
Embrace all my magic and journey beyond
these are some of the things that I want
 
Give me dinners with graces, and kind loving faces, who've known me for lifetimes and held me in crises
without wondering what they would get in return

I want to be swept up in frenzies of laughter and mirth, in the friendship that show me that this is the care I deserve

I want to plant my feet firm on the earth that's around me,
and to walk without fear that it will all fall away.
To know and believe that right here, and right now, I belong,
and it won't all get taken away.
To relate with the land and the sky and the water, and all of the beings they brought up

I want to bear myself children
without wondering how I will feed them,
Or who will embrace them,
Or what will be left for them 

I want a balance of anchors and water, and soil and helium
Where theres room to make roots that extend and then fruit from celestial mycelium
 
I want the freedom of movement, through networks and grooves bent like highways and speed trains to the places im needed,  

I want to easily put away things that aren't mine, close the doors on the things that I cannot divine, disengage from the torments that are crossing a line
 
I want gratitude filling me up, and flowing like fountains,
effortless, constant, and forming big mountains
I want beautiful bedrooms with views of horizons,
And Forests and oceans and rainbow sunrises

I want existing to feel good,
I want communications where you feel understood
Let us celebrate learning from our mistakes
Let us have good supports that lift us up and won't break  

I want to love myself without dreading or doubting,
I want to end all the curses that were cast by those sinking and shouting
I want to validate needs and ask freely for all that I'm wanting
And take steps to build wonderful worlds even when it feels daunting 

I want people, and passions, and love that's unrationed,
and a joy that spreads out to the world
Transcendental experiences, Ecstatic delriums
and a throughline that weaves our lives
With the stories of how we survived
With the stories of how we all thrived
With the story of how we're alive
We're alive
We are life
We areÂ
