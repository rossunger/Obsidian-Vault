[[Dean Jefferson]] was getting too old for this job. He would have retired
years ago, but every year there seemed to be some catastrophic reason
that he just had to stay for one more year. First it was corruption,
then the ridiculous gender laws, then student revolts. One year the
board of directors couldn't find an appropriate replacement, another
year the competition was so fierce that they were worried about
insurgency.

Dean didn't care about the institution, but he felt a responsibility to
the students. So many bright minds had walked these halls and gone on to
change the world. A disruption to their education could have denied
humanity a [[Lisgard]], or a [[Tennerman]], or a [[Luxford]], or a [[Jonas]]. We may
have even gone extinct.

As he stared at the student horde he wondered what this year's cohort
would bring. Every year Jefferson selected 10 of the brightest minds to
join a [[secret society]] he had started when he was a student. In essence
it was a think tank designed to transcend the limitations of what was
accepted as possible. He hoped that the brilliant minds of tomorrow
could break the shackles of today. That was his motto.

This year he had gone further than ever before. As an experiment, he had
gone to the lower levels to scout [[Zoli]], the most left of center thinker
he could find. It was a risky decision that could really backfire, but
he was so sick of the status quo that sometimes a little trouble seemed
better than nothing.
