I have talked over women and
I have been a leader when it wasn't my place
I have prioritized myself and
I have taken up too much space

It was me,
and I'm sorry
Yes I have been that guy
it's not alright
And it's not okay,
Yes, I have made mistakes
It's not about me
Or my feelings
It's accountability
I want to take responsibility for

I have relied on your emotional labour
I have made degrading jokes and songs
I have been defensive and dismissive and
I have said nothing when I knew it was wrong

It was me,
and I'm sorry
Yes I have been that guy
it's not alright
And it's not okay,
Yes, I have made mistakes
It's not about me
Or my feelings
It's accountability
I want to take responsibility for

I have checked you out when you didn\'t want that
I have said things that I never meant
I have fed my ego by dating you
I have failed to get proper consent

It was me,
and I'm sorry
Yes I have been that guy
it's not alright
it's not okay,
Yes, I have made mistakes
It's not about me
Or my feelings
It's accountability
I want to take responsibility for

I will try to make amends
I will denounce these awful trends
I will From the bottom of my heart
I promise this is just the start

I will read more books by women.
I will shut my mouth, for women
I will try my best to take up less space.
I will not erase, I will not displace
The women in my life
And I'll embrace
My disgrace
Yes, I have made mistakes
It's not about me
Or my feelings
It's accountability
I want to take responsibility for
