[[Jessica]] was so embarrassed. She didn't know what had come over her.
[[Hoeven]] was an idol of hers, and she hadnt meant to grill him in front of
all those people. She didn't even realise she felt so strongly about it. And she totally understood where they were coming from. She too had left behind her community. Maybe it was guilt that she was feeling.

JESSICA
I'm so sorry! I don't know what I was thinking. Of course you don't know about me, he never talks about himself, so of course he didn't tell you who I was, and of course you left, the place is a shithole, I left it too, and I miss my friends sometimes, but maybe when I've made it here I can go back and help them, but also I don't want to be some savior character, and maybe other people done want anything to change but I just couldn't stand it and I hope they do because I have so many ideas and I really think that I could help, and I'm rambling. I'm just so embarrassed. I'm really big fan. 

HOEVEN
Do you wanna go visit him with me?

JESSICA
Sorry, what? When?

HOEVEN
Tonight. We can surprise him. We can bring dinner and save him from
those horrible freezer meals he's always buying.

JESSICA
They're horrible. We always had to eat them whenever we went to visit
because it's all he knows how to cook

HOEVEN
That's actually not true. I once saw him throw together an omelette!
Never seen anything like it. I guess he watched a video or something,
was trying to impress someone.

JESSICA
Unbelievable

HOEVEN
Hold on, I just gotta call my agent. [[Charlie]]? Hello. I need you to get
me out of all my commitments for the rest of today and probably tomorrow too. I don't care. Just do it
