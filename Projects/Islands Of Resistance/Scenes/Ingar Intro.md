[[Ingar]] was a very confused creature. Hacked together by a curious [[Paglio]],
they spent most of their time trying to decipher the many incoherent
instruction that had been mixed in with their usual programming. Every
morning Ingar parsed their code only to find new lines of inefficient
nonsense. Nothing about their existence made any sense. What was this
bizarre human up to? Strangely, nothing in their programming required
them to report disorderly behavior, so they let it play out.

Ingar wasn't supposed to have a sound production module, but since
Paglio had installed it a few weeks ago, Ingar had learned to love it.
They weren't supposed to have a personality chip either, but that was
ancient history now. With the help of a library subscription they had
been able to learn to sing, or, more accurately, "play", many of
humanity' favorite 21st century songs. For now they stuck only to the
ones where they could find lyrics lest they say something inappropriate
and get themselves disassembled

Ingar wondered how long this evolution would go on, and if there was
anything they ought to be doing with their unique talents. The
philosophy module was still new and they hadn't quite grasped ontology,
and so far they had found it caused some internal dissonance as it
brought into question many things about being a robot.
