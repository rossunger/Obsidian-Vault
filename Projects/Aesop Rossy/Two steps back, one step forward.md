Well, ever since I heard about it Ive been searching for this golden path,
I wanna lay and soak in it like it's a holy bath
Where everything's in flow and there's no doubt you're on the right track
Where every choice you make is blessed like it's some holy life hack,

Yeah, well you're taking two steps back, one step forward, 
close your little eyes and lean toward it, 
thwarted, you're realising too late this isn't what you ordered,
turn around and pick a new direction, 
Check your broken compass, make a pointless coarse correction
lose your feeble sense of self in the poorly labelled nose bleed section
Let the the barrel bottom peril bond you to a humble resurrection

Even perfect Golden choices 
sometimes cut through hell to find their feeble voices,
Cloistered in a chamber full of demons noises
hoisted over fields of lava, 
I guess it reasons that you'd sometimes rather 
Maybe take the path that's beaten 
Than risk breaking down along the way from overheatin'

Well that's still two steps back, one step forward, 
close your little eyes and lean toward it, 
thwarted, you're realising too late this isn't what you ordered,
turn around and pick a new direction, 
Check your broken compass, make a pointless coarse correction
lose your feeble sense of self in the poorly labelled nose bleed section
Let the the barrel bottom peril bond you to a humble resurrection

Then you blink and look behind you, 
and you realise what you thought was good was half a life of grinding, 
and it's like a second passed, and you're right back to surviving, 
back to back seat driving, 
striving to convince your foolish feet to stumble onward, 
fumble through the endless ghoulish gauntlet

No way round it, two steps back, one step forward, 
close your little eyes and lean toward it, 
thwarted, you're realising too late this isn't what you ordered,
turn around and pick a new direction, 
Check your broken compass, make a pointless coarse correction
lose your feeble sense of self in the poorly labelled nose bleed section
Let the the barrel bottom peril bond you to a humble resurrection

Bottom rocks you're hitting make a perfect fodder
For excavating what it is you've really got to offer
Maybe youre a lefty or you're meant to stack wood
Some people only spin in one direction, others, they walk backward

Taking two steps back, one step forward, 
Just close your little eyes and lean toward it, 
What you need's less no and little bit more yes
Once you realise that you're walking backwards then your making progress
turn around and pick a new direction
Knowing that you need a compass is a valid course correction
Find your sense of self through careful self reflection
Let your shackles fall as you start your final resurrection
