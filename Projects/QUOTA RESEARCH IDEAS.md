-   **Australia\'s humanitarian intake** has remained relatively steady
    > over the last 20 years, with around **12,000 to 13,000** people
    > typically accepted every year.

-   In 2015-16, Australia accepted 13,750 people through its
    > humanitarian programme and has committed to accepting an
    > **additional 12,000** refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq.

-   Asylum seekers have attempted to reach Australia on boats from
    > Indonesia, often paying large sums of money to people smugglers.
    > Hundreds have died making the dangerous journey.

-   At its peak, 18,000 people arrived in Australia illegally by sea.
    > However the numbers plummeted after the government introduced
    > tough new policies to \"stop the boats\".

#### **What is an Asylum seeker?**

-   **Fact:** An asylum seeker is someone seeking protection because
    > they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of
    > their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership
    > of a particular social group. An asylum seeker could also be
    > someone who is fleeing other serious human rights violations,
    > including torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or
    > punishment. Not every asylum seeker will ultimately be recognised
    > as a refugee, but every refugee is initially an asylum seeker.

#### **What is a Refugee?**

-   **Fact:** A refugee is a person who has fled persecution, has sought
    > protection and has been granted refugee status. A refugee may be
    > residing in a refugee camp waiting for an opportunity to return to
    > their home country, waiting for resettlement in another country,
    > or may have been resettled in another country such as Australia.

#### **What is a Migrant?**

-   **Fact:** A migrant is a person who chooses to leave their country,
    > generally to seek work, undertake study or be reunited with
    > family. They can return home at any time if things don\'t work
    > out.

### **Are people who seek asylum and come to Australia by boat \'illegal\'?**

-   **Fact: No, they are not.**

-   [[Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human
    > Rights]{.underline}](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a14)
    > states everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution in
    > other countries. Human rights are universal. They are basic
    > freedoms and protections that everyone is entitled to.

-   It is not illegal for people to flee persecution in their homeland
    > or to cross borders without documents or passports in order to
    > seek asylum. It is not a crime under Australian law to arrive here
    > by boat without a valid visa and ask for protection.

-   People have been fleeing persecution in their homelands for
    > centuries, such as during the fall of the Roman Empire, during
    > World War I and II and during the Vietnam War.

-   More recently, religious, ethnic and political conflicts in Asia,
    > Africa and the Middle East have left people with no choice but to
    > flee persecution.

-   The [[Refugee Council of
    > Australia]{.underline}](http://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/) points
    > out that for some refugees in some parts of the world it can be
    > far too dangerous to apply for a passport and/or an exit visa, and
    > equally dangerous to approach an Australian embassy for a visa.
