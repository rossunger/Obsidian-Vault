The Silverman twins sat in the [[lawyers office]] and tried to reconcile
their conflicting feelings, torn between mourning the death of a father
they never loved, and celebrating an the news of an inheritance they
never thought they'd see. They were the heirs to the [[SunPatch empire]],
which technically makes them the two wealthiest people on the planet,
richer, even, than the King of Q.

"Sun patches", kinda like nicotine patches, can replace a persons
daily Sun intake, however they are not cheap. The middle class can
afford them, but folks at the bottom levels cant. These patches can
replace food also, as they provide energy to your body.

Judea and [[Alara Silverman|Alara]] had grown up in the [[sunclave]] on the first floor (top
down). They had never experienced what it meant to live in scarcity.
Every moment of their lives was meticulously planned out for them by a
now deceased father, and they very quickly learned how impossible it was
to deviate from this prescription.

On his 5th birthday, Judea had tried sneak into the office to catch a
glimpse of the surprise presents he had been overhearing about, and to
this day he is haunted by the excruciating pain of the electric shock
that struck his central nervous system. At birth, his father had
implanted the twins with behaviour [[control circuitry]] which allowed him
to control their every move, which is why they were sitting in the
lawyers office with a difficult choice to make.

Now that [[Oster Silverman]] was gone, they were given a one time
opportunity to remove the circuitry, and forge a life of their own, but
only if they were prepared to give up their share of the Silverman
fortune. They had 5 minute to decide.

Alara had already made her choice, but Judea was having second thoughts.
Seeing what his father had planned out for him, it didn't seem too bad.
Decent lifestyle, no complication, nothing to worry about. But he was
worried about leaving his sister alone in the unknown. If he took the
inheritance, he would have no way to help his sister.

Moment of truth

ALARA
Get this thing out of me

JOHNSON
Are you sure about this?

ALARA
GET IT OUT

JOHNSON
Ok! Ok! And you, Judea?

Panicked, Judea opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out

JOHNSON:
Judea?

Daily life for Judea had become all about routine. The prescription that
his father had laid out for him resulted in a subtle monotony that had
shaded the colours of his life. Emotions, even fear, had become muted as
his existence faded into the background of his father's empire. The days
dragged on. He kept up on matters of finance, of wealth management, on
company media, on signing the dotted line. His weekly board meetings
were the few hours he spent connecting with others. But, these
interactions lacked meaning and often left him feeling isolated. He
couldn't help but wonder what his sister Alara was doing.

Now his only solace from this seemingly meaningless hours, was the time
spent plugged into the simulated world of pleasure. He had developed a
ritual, one which he surely conducted every day. It started with a long
bath. He would listen to a meditation track, tuned to the frequency of
devotion. He would slip just under the surface as the track rang out to
an echo in his large apartment in the sunclave. He would imagine what it
would feel like if water rushed into his ears and fried the circuit that
rested in his brain. He imagined what it would feel like if he had
chosen differently.

After he had cleansed himself of his daily regrets, he would approach
the computer and plug into his favourite simulation. He had commissioned
its creation with the help of the university, based on a reoccuring
dream he would have as a child. The setting seemed to be an offshoot of
a storybook his mother had read to him. It was a fantastical world
filled with the greens and blues of an ancient past. Here, the weather
was warm and the sun was just the right temperature. He met all manner
of characters, ranging from those he knew, to those completely
fabricated by his own being. In this world he was not tied by any
constraints of biology or duty and he could be fully himself. On this
particular occasion he was feeling what he remembered of loneliness and
thus set out for the salt caves. There, his simulated companion was
waiting. He had constructed her years ago from a fantasy, but had grown
quite fond of her. She represented the closest thing to family for him
these days.

He walked the same pathway he always did, one that had become worn with walking. Yet something felt different this time. The feeling seemed to
originate from somewhere in his body... maybe in his chest. It caused him to pick up his pace. The mouth of the cave was just in the distance. The feeling in his chest amplified.

"Hello?" He called, pulling the entrance curtain back. [[Geraldine]], his companion, greeted him with a big smile and a hug. She was always happy
to see him, and he liked this aspect of the simulation. "Judea! We have a visiter!" She said excitedly. This was not something he anticipated, and he wondered how the simulation chose to generate these surprises... Geraldine stepped aside to reveal his sister Alara had come to visit. He was overcome with happiness, and finally understood the feeling of anticipation that had been growing inside of him all morning. He had not seen his sister since that day at the lawyers office, no matter his resolve to manifest her presence. It seemed he was due to provide a bonus to the university for their progress in the simulation.

"Alara...." He started, moving to embrace his sister's image. She looked
older, dressed informally. "Hi Judea." She returned. Her body language
looked closed off and cold, and the lack of desire to embrace was
glaringly obvious. He found this strange, as the usual response for
simulated characters was that of adoration. Alas, he realized that much
had changed between him and his sister, thus he applauded the complexity
of this ever-changing program.

#judea spends his life trying to find his sister, whichever proves to be
impossible because his father had planned for that.

#Judea has to deal with a secret society thats trying to steal the
secrets

#judea overcomes great pain to protect sister.

#alara faces poverty. Gets screwed over lots. Always miraculously saved
in the nick of time, because her dad had planned for this and had
someone watching over her.

#Alara uses the computer simulation that her brother commissioned,
paired with the control circuitry to infiltrate her brother's psyche.
This is how she extracts secrets about the company. She has grown to
disrespect her brother because of his choices, and his lack of contact.

#alara forges her own path...becomes the head of a secret society...
Uses secrets from her past life to steal technology, then leaves the
city and builds her own Empire.

~~Before he knew it, Judea was sitting in a bubble bath watching the
sunset outside his floor to ceiling windows.~~
