[[Xavier]] wasn't like the other kids. He knew that. But he wasn't quite
sure why. At first they thought he was on the spectrum, which he was,
but that didn't explain why he just knew things he wasnt supposed to
know. In most cases, it made it impossible for him to have friends.
People hated that he would sense every subtle shift in their energy
without their consent. Xavier tried to stop, but he couldn't help it.
It wasn't a choice. But not everybody treated it like a problem

Xavier was very popular among the friendly neighborhood revolutionaries.
They venerated his intuition as a rare talent and often employed him as
a human lie detector. They liked that he helped them hold each other
accountable. Xavier didn't understand the politics of it all, but he
liked being around all these intelligent adults and it felt good to be
wanted.

"He's ok" Xavier remembered [[Lexler]] from when his father had first met
him, and his intuition suggested nothing suspicious. However, there was
a stranger in the corner who Xavier didn't recognize, and their energy
seemed unintelligible. "This one's new." Xavier approached the corner
and sat down quietly. The two of them sat quietly for a few moments, and
then Xavier spoke

XAVIER
"I like you"

[[FRANCIS]]
Nobody's ever said that to me before

XAVIER
Assholes

FRANCIS
I'm Frankie

XAVIER
You're not a very good liar

FRANCIS
Francis

XAVIER
You work for the government?

FRANCIS
Yes

XAVIER
You gonna rat us out?

FRANCIS
Probably

XAVIER
Do you want us to kill you?

FRANCIS
I'd rather you didn't

XAVIER
Good answer. What do you want us to do with you?

FRANCIS
I'd rather just not find anything

XAVIER
What are you looking for?

FRANCIS
The Prince of Q, apparently

XAVIER
Oh boy.

FRANCIS
That's what I said

XAVIER
I suppose the people you're working for don't realise your queer?

FRANCIS
I'm not queer

XAVIER
Oh. Huh. My mistake. Listen. Here's what we're gonna do. [[Cheech]]
over there is gonna teach you how to lie, and you're gonna come work
for us. Keep collecting your paycheck, and feeding them whatever we tell
you, and you can live like one of us. Who knows, maybe you'll even
discover something about yourself. How does that sound?

Xavier watched the human across from him began to tremble and finally burst into tears.

FRANCIS
I just wanted a normal job, a simple desk clerk, or something in HR. I was never meant to be an agent. I don't do well under pressure. I don't like risks. I don't deal well with uncertainty. I can't so this. I just wanna go home.

XAVIER
It's gonna be ok
