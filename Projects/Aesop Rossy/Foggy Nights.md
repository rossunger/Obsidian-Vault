![[Foggy nights.m4a]]
Foggy nights 
cascading twinkle lights 
cut god rays through the urban blight, 
illuminating, moonlit, bright
Intangible ascendants preach a holy height
And I'm a convert, 
Once a cynic, now I sing their song
In voices of a thousand ancient throngs

I'm recognizing now how deep our spirits long 
For that primordial connection, 
For that ethereal ascension
Feel the lineage reflection
Self aware dissection
That pure hearted spiritual convection
Where you and I both carry crucial pieces
And we know that anything but honest truth will fleece us 
of our chance to end the broken cycles

Grease the chain and pedal hard, 
outrun the stale garbage that we reluctantly recycle
And restore the natural order, 
And resync with all creation
Go Return to land, and air and fire 
And resist the old temptation, 

For you know that this is where you ought to be. 
You know that this is where youve got to be 
Keep faith in all of them and you and me
We ride the waves to freedom from this eternal dream
We wake into reality and shake ourselves lest we should fall asleep
We're fighting for our earth-born right to live and love and be, and breathe

We're righting our ancestral woes 
and opening the window for the winds of change to freely flow
Collecting lingered fragments
of a crusted past that's stagnant, 

Let the life return and burn inside our yearning hollow bones, 
And let the movement stoke our senses
Let the yearnings wake and mend us
Let the morning air ascend us
Forming sacred songs, transcend us
In ice shattering crescendos

Let the river run unending
May out children know their bendings
Tending seeds that have been planted
May their children understand it

Now that finally we've landed
Let the roots of all our nations
Interweave with all creation

Let us feed each other's brethren
Let us breathe each other's breath then 
Let us grieve each other's losses
Let us seed each other's causes
Let us celebrated our forces
We're alive in fields of horses
Tilling soils of ancient warzones
And we bring each other pieces
And we turn each other's keys and
We're just watching through the portals
Flapping wings and feeling mortal
Singing songs and ....
