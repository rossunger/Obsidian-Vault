[Premise]{.underline}

The world has stopped liking musicals. As a result, all colour is fading
away. You must investigate this mysterious loss of interest in musicals,
and in the process restore colour to the world.

[Gameplay]{.underline}

− Diablo style RPG, except you can\'t kill baddies, you can only
"convert" them.

\-- As you visit different villages in the world, you pick up new styles
of music.

− You convert them by creating musical theatre, and showing them how
awesome it really is.

− Some baddies can only be converted by converting the lesser baddies
around them.

− Some baddies are resistant/immune to certain methods of conversion

− Instead of weapons and armour etc. you collect:

− musicians pickup Musical Instruments

> − Techies pick up Lighting and Sound equipment, fabrics, set elements
> (rostra, cycs, etc.)
>
> − Designers pick up "ideas"; writers pick up plot points; composers
> pick up themes/sounds

− Performers pick up body enhancers (e.g. )

− KOTOR style characters...

− Get to play as/with the greats

> − e.g. Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Sondheim,
> Webber,
>
> Schwartz, Ahrens and Flaherty, etc.

[Story]{.underline}

\*SPOILER ALERT\*

Part 1

− The colour has disappeared from your world. You get together a team to
investigate. Turns out it is because people have lost their love for
musicals

− You set about to rectify the situation by producing good travelling
show. As you do good

shows you colourise the world.

− You return home to find that your town has been de-colourised, and
your loved

ones/mentors slaughtered

Part 2

− You set off to find the villains (Walt Disney?) who did it

− Discover that they de-colourise the world by creating bad musicals.

− You set of on a journey towards their main castle, to defeat their
leader

− You colourise towns along the way

− Rome TW style campaign map\...each city is controlled by a "minion"
and you have to

defeat them using tactical combat

− When you reach the castle and defeat the guards, you break the seal,
and enter the chamber

of Walt Disney (whom nobody has entered for hundreds of years)

− Discover that he is, in fact, dead. On the floor you find plans for a
masterpiece that will

change the world of musicals, his magnus opus.
