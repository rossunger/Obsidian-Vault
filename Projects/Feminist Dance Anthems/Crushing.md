From the moment that I met you I could tell something was up
I could feel my heartbeat racing and excitement filled my cup
As you conjured words of kindness and an air of real care
I just wanted to be close with you see your soul laid bare

I'm crushing on you, because you're wonderful
I'm crushing on you, and it feels wonderful
I hope I get to know you in whatever way feels right
Thanks for being awesome! alright!

Then I said stop, brain, check yourself, what is this feeling?
Am I assuming I want romance? or sex? or just a summer fling?
Maybe I just wanna be their friend or brush their hair?
I don't have to know right now, just practice deep deep care

I'm crushing on you, because you're wonderful
I'm crushing on you, and it feels wonderful
I hope I get to know you in whatever way feels right
Thanks for being awesome, alright!

And it really doesn't have to be romantic
And promise I won't try to make you mine
I just think that you're pretty amazing
And I would love to be around you all the time

I'm crushing on you, because you're wonderful
I'm crushing on you, and it feels wonderful
I hope I get to know you in whatever way feels right
Thanks for being awesome, alright!

-   Just wanna be transparent

-   Feel pulled towards you and I'm not sure why

-   Doesn't have to change anything

-   I'm crushing on you and I don't know why, I guess I really like
    your ba ba ba ba hi!

-   Doesn't have to be romantic

-   I'm just infatuatedly excited about you
