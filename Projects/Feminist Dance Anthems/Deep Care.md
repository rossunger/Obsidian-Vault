Deep Care, I wanna move through life with
Deep Care, I wanna cultivate
Deep Care, Making space and time for
Deep Care

Life just moves so fast
Unless we slow it down
People left behind
People left to drown
That is not the world I want to live in; I want better for my
family and friends and all the people in my life I want

Deep Care, I wanna move through life with
Deep Care, I wanna cultivate
Deep Care, Making space and time for
Deep Care

Groups can be so hard
To navigate alone
To know what way to be
To share what you need
That is not the world I want to live in; I want better for my
family and friends and all the people in my life I want

Deep Care, I wanna move through life with
Deep Care, I wanna cultivate
Deep Care, Making space and time for
Deep Care

Sometimes when we hurt
Our response is to exert
Our power over each other
But I don't want to live that way, I would rather

Deep Care, I wanna move through life with
Deep Care, I wanna cultivate
Deep Care, Making space and time for
Deep Care

I want to be there when you laugh
I want to be there when you cry
I want to be there when you're anxious
Or when you feel like you're gonna die

I want your anger to have space
I want to hold you when you're low
I want to celebrate your joys
I want to help you change and grow

Deep Care, I wanna move through life with
Deep Care, I wanna cultivate
Deep Care, Making space and time for
Deep Care

People want so much
We all work so
Hard to keep it up
Scared to let them down
