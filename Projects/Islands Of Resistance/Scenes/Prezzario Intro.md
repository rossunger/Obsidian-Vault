[[Prezzario]] was snazzy. They liked to dress nice, they liked to think
quick, they liked to talk smooth, but most importantly they were a
fantastic dancer, and they knew it. They were the kinda character that
would put a giant smile on your face, if they didn't annoy the hell
outta you, and every year their natal day shenanigans seemed to get
bigger and bigger, both figuratively and literally. An inexperienced
onlooker might mistake their grandiose ritual, which now spanned an
entire city block, for a devotional celebration of the birth of our
beloved city, which may have been the case if Prezzario's wasn't so busy
tapping into what he considered his most potent superpower: pizzazz.
