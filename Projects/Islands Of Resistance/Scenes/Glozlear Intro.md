A musical about how having your neighborhood rearranged can tear your
life apart\... Not being able to find a place to live, separation from
loved ones, access to services/clients.

A story of one person\'s mission to reach the city gods to convince them
to leave their neighborhood alone\... Fighting through red tape, and
eventually reaching them, but they don\'t care. There\'s too many
factors to consider, and they're doing their best.
