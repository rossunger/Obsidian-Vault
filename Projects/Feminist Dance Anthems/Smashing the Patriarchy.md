*Passengers please reach under your seats to locate your umbrellas. 
We will be smashing the glass ceiling in three, two, one...

*The year is 2051, the war has finally been won, 
we live in freedom, freedom from the man, 
we're all just human beings, running through the land. 
We've torn down race, we've torn down class, 
we've torn down gender, we're free at last*

*I'm standing on this hill and I see this harmony
And my heart fills with this lightness, this joy
This is how it's meant to be. 
This is how it's meant to be
And I'm so fucking proud
Then I wake up here and now....*

*Noooo*

So here we are we're looking good. What's going on?
Smashing the patriarchy, one day at a time
The systems broke, and we feel alone,
Gosh, life is hard
Each step we take just leaves us scarred

Smash the patriarchy, 
smash the oligarchy, 
smash the hierarchy 
smash, smash 

We're tired, sure, but we can't stop now
We just need to heal
I see your pain and I know it's real
Can't bring them down, but we can lift us up
We'll rise above
Hey! down with power, up with Love

Smash the patriarchy, 
smash the oligarchy, 
smash the hierarchy 
smash smash smash them all

I'm sick of my friends and i being gendered, misgendered, or
racialized, or patronized, or plagiarized, or socialised to be monsters
Or typecast or cast out
Or chastised or passed out
Or dismissed or blacklisted
Words twisted checklisted
damn right we're pissed
Our existence is resistance to persistent world views, Lame excuses,
overuses of fake news, hitting snooze on alarming abuse of people,
planet, dammit I can't stand another day of people breaking, and
aching, quaking with fear and/ or fury, a jury
Forsaking our future, forgetting our past,
We're moving too fast
we're coming out last
All this wealth we've amassed
We've harassed and lambasted
The downcast, the bastards
Never asked us and
The forecast is bleak
Doublethink, doublespeak,

Tear us down with critique
"This physique too oblique"
Its a brutal technique
Make us feel so unique
That we cannot relate
Go on dates
"Queer or straight?"
"Have you put on some weight?"
"How are you? Oh I'm great"
Here, clean slate,

So they keep us sedated, underrated, unappreciated, and so we have to
remember that rome wasn't built in a day, and if we watch what we say,
and choose who we pay, and challenge cliches, slowly chipping away at
the bullshit hearsay,

We might not feel it today, but in our own little way we will be
smashing the patriarchy

Smash the patriarchy, smash the oligarchy, smash the hierarchy smash
smash smash them all

Smash the patriarchy, smash the oligarchy, smash the hierarchy smash
smash smash
