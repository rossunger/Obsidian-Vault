[[Juniper]] was dying. She knew it was bound to happen, but this time it was
for real. Probably. Maybe. She looked at the ultrasounds. It was huge.
She didn't realise tumours could be so big. How did she not notice?

Juniper had tried to act normal but it was proving impossible. Today, in
an elementary class about storytelling that she was teaching, she spent
20 minutes taking about death. The kids seemed to understand, but they
had been expecting to share the stories they'd written about their
weekend, and it was all a little much

As she catatonically sipped on a curly straw submerged in an empty
glass, she waited for a phone call from the [[health department]] telling
her how long she had left. She would've have sat there waiting forever
if it weren't for an old friend recognizing her and walking her home.
