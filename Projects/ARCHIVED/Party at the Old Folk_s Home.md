Hey, when are you coming to visit?

Oh\...ok.

Look, I'm really busy, I gotta run, but we should talk soon?

**Jeremiah:** Looking good doris ;)

*A volunteer is playing scrabble with Sally, the world champion*

**Sally:** Quizzify. 419 points

**Jeremiah:** 419?! That's impossible!

**Volunteer:** It may as well be. A 'Z', a 'Qu', AND a blank tile,
across two triple words? give me

> a break.

**Jeremiah:** That's why she's the state champion.

**Volunteer:** I didn't know she was the state champion!

**Jeremiah:** She's trying to keep a low profile

*Jeremiah lines up to get his pills.*

**Jeremiah:** (flirts with the nurse)?

**Nurse Pills:** Not a chance

**Jeremiah:** Oh Come on :P

**Nurse Pills:** You forget that I know what pills your taking

**Jeremiah:** Well, I don't have to take them ;)

**Nurse Pills:** Just take your pills Jeremiah. Also, your son's been
calling.

**Jeremiah:** I know i just spoke with him. Sometimes I wish they hadn't
invented phones.

> Maybe he'd finally come and visit me.

**Nurse Pills:** Have you thought about skyping him

**Jeremiah:** I'm not skyping him. If he wants to see me he can come and
visit.

> *The hospice Nurse is trying to find him, but he's avoiding her.*
>
> *The technicians are setting up for funeral streaming.*

**Jeremiah:** What's with the cameras? Was she a movie star or
something?

**Technician:** No, it's live funeral streaming

**Jeremiah:** Funeral what?

**Technician:** It's the way of the future man. People watching funerals
from the comfort of their

> own home

**Jeremiah:** Gimme a break. I've been going to funerals for 40 years,
no one's gonna want to

> watch this on the TV. We're not royalty here. Except Agnes, she might
> be. We
>
> never know with her
>
> *Jeremiah walks on. Two old people Slow Motion Scooter for the last
> donut. Jeremiah walks in and wins*

**Jeremiah:** Suckers!

**Agnes:** You call this a shnitzel? Can you believe they're offering US
cooking classes? we

> should be giving THEM cooking classes
>
> *X is getting his meal*

**X:** And don't you skimp on the gravy. I'm too old to care about
cholesterol. I'll eat

*She looks at him scared*

**Jeremiah:** It's me, Jeremiah

> Oh, of course, the Dementia*...*
>
> *Jeremiah sees X being given a tour and crying because they feel
> guilty putting their mother in a home.*

**Jeremiah:** Moving to this home is gonna be the best thing that's ever
happened to her. Trust

> me. My social life's hit an all time high; and a pretty thing like
> her, she's gonna be a star.

*Jeremiah arrives for a health check up. He flirts with the female
doctor. She remains*

*professional.*

**Jeremiah:** So what's the verdict doc? I'm fit as a fiddle, right? :D

**Doctor:** Well, you're at that age where it could be anything. Your
heart's not ticking the

> way it used to. Tiny blackouts are pretty common, but if they get any
> bigger,
>
> please see me immediately. I'm gonna prescribe you some more of these
> guys

*Holds up pills*

**Jeremiah:** Don't they make you constipated?

**Doctor:** Sure, why don't you take these?

**Jeremiah:** They make me sick

**Doctor:** What about these?

**Jeremiah:** They make me Gassy

**Doctor:** These?

**Jeremaih:** Too-

**Doctor:** Why don't you try some prunes?

**Jeremiah:** Aaaaaalrighty then.

**Doctor:** On another note, the blood tests we did have shown up
positive for Chlamydia,

> so you're gonna have to take these pills, twice a day for 10 days

**Jeremiah:** Chlamydia? gah

**Doctor:** And I know you're not worried about pregnancy, but I'd like
you to start using

> protection

**Jeremiah:** Life's too short for that.

*She frowns*

**Doctor:** Sexually transmitted infections are serious problem Jerry.
You'll end up with

> Hepatitis and then you won't be laughing.

**Jeremiah:** Ok fine. Gimme some of the extra large ones.\
Ok, fine, the regular ones.

> *She hands him some condoms and he continues.*

**Jeremiah:** Why is judge judy on? it's 10 oclock?

**X:** I finally figured out how to use this Tivo thing.

**Jeremiah:** Tivo?

**X:** It's a recording

**Jeremiah:** Oh, so it's judge judy the movie?

**X:** No its judge judy the show

**Jeremiah:** But judge judy's on at 4.

**X:** Here's what you do; you push this button here, and then you set
the timer here

> and then you push record and then when it's done you can watch it
> whenever you want

**Jeremiah:** Since when did TV get so complicated. I remember when it
was just a black and

> white box with a clicker\...none of these fancy buttons that do god
> knows what"

*X is on the phone.*

**X:** How many times do I have to tell you, you have to come fix my
goddamn hearing

> aid.

**Recording:** Sorry. I didn't catch that. Did you mean "Social
Services"

**X:** No, I did not mean social services!

**Recording:** For sales, press 1. For maintenance, press 2-

**X:** Gah!

> *At a wake\...*

**Jeremiah:** Ugh. Tuna? again?

...*Jeremiah is looking around, he doesn't seem to know anyone.*

**Jeremiah:** Where is everybody Jim? Jim?

*He looks at the body, realises he's at the wrong wake! He leaves.*

*Alicia joins him.*

**Alicia:** How was the wake

**Jeremiah:** I went to the wrong one

**Alicia:** Again?

**Jeremiah:** The refreshments are really going downhill. Nobody takes
pride in a good spread

> these days. Remember the Jefferson's funeral? they had an
> ice-sculpture, and a champagne fountain

**Alicia:** They did not!

**Jeremiah:** Didn't they? but at least they took pride in their cheese

> selection.
>
> *Alicia is mildly offended by the irreverence*

**Jeremiah:** You know it's not about the food, right? I go to funerals
because nobody ever

> says bad things about you at a funeral. It's the one time in someone's
> life when everyone who cares about them comes together to appreciate
> them. It's a beautiful sight.

**Alicia:** What are you gonna do when there's no funerals left to go to

**Jeremiah:** What're you talking about? there'll always be funerals.
It's not like people are

> gonna stop dying

**Alicia:** They might

**Jeremiah:** Gah.

**Alicia:** Who have we got today?

**Jeremiah:** Maude's at 2pm, and Callum's at 5.

**Alicia:** Did you hear about Eliza

**Jeremiah:** In the bath tub? what a tragedy

**Alicia:** Have they set the day yet?

**Jeremiah:** Wednesday afternoon

**Alicia:** Wednesday afternoon? what about Quincy?

**Jeremiah:** We might have to skip Quincy; I didn't know him that well,
and plus, this way we

> can go to Katerina's too, and she was friends with the Murphy sisters,
> maybe they'll sing a song

**Alicia:** Those little angels

**Jillian:** (from offstage) Jeremiah?

**Jeremiah:** Oh god!

*He turns the corner and hides.*

**Jeremiah:** It's that new 'hospice' lady

*Jillian comes in. Looks around, confused*

**Jillian:** Have you seen Jerry?

**Alicia:** I think he went that way

*Exit Jillian, dubious. Jeremiah comes out of hiding.*

**Alicia:** You're hiding now?

**Jeremiah:** She drives me nuts. Always trying to get me to read those
stupid pamphlets as if

> I'm dying-

*Jillian sneaks up on them.*

**Jillian:** Now Jeremiah, have you thought some more about planning
your big day?

**Jeremiah:** Ga!

**Jillian:** You're not gonna be around forever you know

**Jeremiah:** Leave me alone. She thinks she knows everything.

**Jillian:** Just take a look at these leaflets.

> *Nightmare sequence. Chorus sing/chant*

**Jeremiah:** Cremation?

**Chorus:** *Burned alive*

**Jeremiah:** Restoration?

**Chorus:** *Zombified*

**Jeremiah:** Live streaming?!

**Chorus:** *Technology*

**Jeremiah:** Get this crap away from me, I'm not

> going anywhere.

**Chorus:** *Destroyed your life*

> *Blackout.*

**SCENE X**

> *When the lights come on, Jeremiah is lying on the floor, and everyone
> is crowded around him.*

**Jeremiah:** These damn floors

**Jillian:** You can't keep blaming the floors Jerry.

**Alicia:** That's the second one this week.

**Jeremiah:** I'm fine!

**Jillian:** Just take a look at these, please. I'm not saying you're
gonna die, but you gotta

> accept it, shit happens. You could fall down some stairs, or get hit
> in the head by a baseball. You need to start making plans. I'm not
> saying send out the invites, but at least make a list of who you'd
> want to see there. Do you even have a will?

**Jeremiah:** Alright alright. Just give me some space.

*Everyone resumes their activities. Jeremiah sits with Alicia*

**Jeremiah:** Can you believe her.

**Alicia:** She's right, you know. How long are we gonna last, really?
With Eliza gone,

> we're the oldest two. I'm sick of crossing names off my list. I don't
> want to be the last to go.

**Jeremiah:** Stop it. You're not going anywhere.

**Alicia:** I don't know why you're so afraid to die; when it's my time,
I'm going. I'm getting

> D N R tattooed on my chest; do not resuscitate. If I stop breathing
> don't you dare jump on my chest or I'll come back and haunt you

**Jeremiah:** You wouldn't get a tattoo

**Alicia:** Probably not, but I'd definitely come back to haunt you

**Jeremiah:** I'm counting on it.\
Now let's go say goodbye to Ginifer*.*

**SCENE X**

*They arrive at a funeral. It's half empty. A priest is babbling in the
background. One*

*man is watching the funeral on his iPad.*

**Jeremiah:** What a turn out! hah. Wait, wasn't Ginifer the one that
everyone liked? where is

> everyone?

*He walks up to an apathetic camera man.*

**Jeremiah:** Where is everyone?

**Cam man:** Watching from the comfort of their home. Or not watching,
who knows.

**Priest:** And now, a few words from her son Gary

*A video feed of Gary appears, and he says a few brief words*

**Gary:** I'm gonna keep this brief. Mom was a great woman. Everyone
liked her. She was

> kind, social, just a good person. She lived a long full life and now
> it's time to let her go. I'm proud to say she was my mother. Peace.

**Jeremiah:** This is ridiculous.

**Priest:** Would anyone else like to say a few words?

**Jeremiah:** I would.

**SONG**

**Jeremiah:** If I might interject

> We've come to pay respect
>
> To Ginifer Dolores
>
> It\'s come to my attention
>
> We may need an intervention
>
> On a point of great contention
>
> There\'s a growing tension
>
> Between all these \"great inventions\"
>
> And conventional ways.
>
> And I\'m feeling apprehension
>
> That in this technological dimension
>
> We have all forgotten what it means
>
> To be connected in person.
>
> Forgive me my objection
>
> But I'm prone to introspect
>
> It's just really not the same effect
>
> If I could just dissect
>
> This trend towards neglecting
>
> The process of connecting
>
> in person, and reflecting
>
> Upon our actions and rejecting
>
> All those technical advances
>
> Which are claiming to enhance us
>
> But they really entrance us.
>
> These radical changes
>
> Are making us strangers

Do you hear what I'm saying?

Is my message conveying?

Am I being unfair?

Does anyone care?

*Everyone is engrossed in their iPads by this point. One person looks
up, and takes a*

*picture of Jeremiah on their device.*

**Jeremiah:** Jesus christ

*He storms off.*

**SCENE X**

**Jeremiah:** Come on Ali-cat, let's find another funeral to gatecrash.

**Alicia:** Maybe we could do something else for a change?

**Jeremiah:** Like what?

**Alicia:** What about Poker?

**Jeremiah:** Too expensive .

**Alicia:** What about Arts and Crafts?

**Jeremiah:** Too messy.

**Alicia:** What about book club?

*He raises an eyebrow disdainfully.*

**Alicia:** Ugh. You and your funerals.

*They reach their rooms. Jeremiah sees someone unpacking boxes of
technology.*

**Jeremiah:** What the hell is going on here?

**Tech:** Just the new system being implemented

*He picks up an iPad*

**Jeremiah:** iPad? I didn't ask for this. Get this crap outta my room

*Jessie calls*

**Jeremiah:** Hey Jessie. It's not a great time. Someone's sabotaging
the home. They're

> implementing some new system.
>
> (to the Tech) I don't want any of your iCrap

**Jessie:** Dad, no one's sabotaging anything. They're just upgrading
the home. You've

> gotta let them do it; it's meant to improve your quality of life.

**Jeremiah:** My quality of life is just fine, thank you very much.

> (to the tech) Put that down!

**Jessie:** Dad. Dad. You don't have to use the iPads, but the nurses
need them to

> monitor you and make sure those black outs don't escalate

**Jeremiah:** What are you talking about? Who told you about the
blackouts?

**Jessie:** Dad, I talk to the nurses more than I talk to you. You never
want to have a

> conversation for more than a few minutes.

**Jeremiah:** I'm busy. Why don't you come visit like you used to?

**Jessie:** I can't! That's why I'm trying to get all this technology
into the nursing home

**Jeremiah:** You're the one behind all this?!

*Jeremiah has a hallucination about a dystopian future world, with
Jessie as a power*

*figure with minions and advanced technology.*

*The chorus sing under Jessie's speech*

**Jessie:** Yes dad.

> The world is changing faster than you can possibly imagine;

**Chorus:** *The winds of change are comin'*

**Jessie:** if you continue being stubborn

**Chorus:** *Your fear is unbecoming*

**Jessie:** and don't embrace the changes that are happening,

**Chorus:** *We build our iPad towers*

**Jessie:** you're gonna get left behind and miss out on all these
opportunities.

**Chorus:** *That sap you of your power*

**Jessie:** And I want to come to visit

**Chorus:** *And he'll never come to visit*

**Jessie:** I really want to come to visit

**Chorus:** *No he'll never come to visit*

**Jessie:** But the thing is, Dad.

**Chorus:** *You're a failure as a father*

*Jeremiah has a blackout. The nightmare stops. We hear jessie keep
talking.*

**Jessie:** I'm sick. I'm really sick. I've had problems for a while,
but I didn't want to worry

> you until I was absolutely sure. I don't know how to say this. They
> just told me; I think I'm dying.
>
> Dad?
>
> Dad?

**Sally:** Gah, no one plays real scrabble anymore.

**Jeremiah:** Oh.

*A priest doing live streaming church*

**Priest:** \...Praise the lord, Amen

**Jeremiah:** Whatchya doing there Chuck? Talking at the TV? Shouldn't
you be at church?

**Priest:** It's live streaming! my son set it up for me. Now I can
perform my sermon from

> the comfort of my own chair!

**Jeremiah:** What? That's ridiculous. How long was I away?

*Jeremiah sees X wearing 3D glasses.*

**Jeremiah:** Those are some pretty swanky glasses there Jim.

**X:** It's for the 3D TV. I can watch \_\_# in 3D!

**Jeremiah:** "3D TV? what the hell is that? That just looks like
nonsense

**X:** You gotta put these on

**Jeremiah:** I'm not putting them on! Get this crap outta my face.

*Agnes is watching TV*

**Instructor:** Really move those hips ladies! Agnes you too!

**Agnes:** Jesus, I can't afford another hip replacement

**Jeremiah:** Agnes?

*She takes out an earphone*

**Agnes:** Jeremiah! so good to see you!

**Jeremiah:** What's going on around here?

**Agnes:** I'm just on the skype with my fitness instructor; can't talk;

*Jeremiah keeps walking, overhears:*

**X:** I found him on oldies-hookups.com. anyway, I was telling him
about my chest

**Jeremiah:** Googled it?

**X:** Yeah, he asked Dr Google, and HE said that I probably had ulcers.

prune.*

**Jeremiah:** Half a prune? oh for gods sake. What is going on around
here

**Alicia:** There's been a few changes around here, but they're really
not that bad.

**Jeremiah:** Not that bad? Everyone's got their noses stuck in those
damn screens

**Alicia:** Jerry. You're starting to sound like an old man. "Those damn
screens"?

> remember when the TV first came out and your parents used to say the
> same thing about you?

**Jeremiah:** But that was different

**Alicia:** How?

**Jeremiah:** It just was, ok?!

*Alicia can see that he's worked up*

**Alicia:** Ok. Come on, let's go to a funeral. It'll cheer

> you up

**Jeremiah:** I guess *(reluctantly)* Who have we got today?

**Alicia:** Let me check

*Alicia pulls out her smartphone to check the diary*

**Jeremiah:** What the hell is that?

**Alicia:** It's a smartphone. It has my diary in it. My son gave it to
me.

**Jeremiah:** Not you too?

**Alicia:** It's actually kinda neat. It has a calendar, and a
calculator, and all my favourite

> photos right here

**Jeremiah:** But they're not real

**Alicia:** I mean, they kind of are. What's the difference really?

**Jeremiah:** What the difference?! you can't touch them, you can't hang
them on your wall! I

> thought you were supposed to be on my side.

**Alicia:** It's not about sides. What was I supposed to do? my son gave
it to me. And now

> he calls twice as often. We can skype

**Jeremiah:** Now you're skyping?!

**Alicia:** You're not giving it a chance

**Jeremiah:** How could you.

**Alicia:** How could I?! How dare you. Jeremiah, I've known you a long
time, and you've

*He storms off to his room.*

**SCENE X**

*A package from Jessie arrives for Jeremiah. He throws it on the table
without opening it*

**Jeremiah:** Can you believe her! backstabbing me like that. She's
supposed to be my friend

**Jessie:** Hey Dad

**Jeremiah:** Hey! Jessie! What's going on? can you hear me? is this
that

> skype thing they've been telling me about?

**Jessie:** I don't know how to tell you this\...I guess like you always
said "out with it".

> If you're seeing this then I'm probably dead. Don't freak out. This is
> a recording.
>
> Kinda like Tivo.

**Jeremiah:** Stop kidding around, you're practically here.

**Jessie:** This must all be very new for you

**Jeremiah:** Yeah. I had no idea it was so real

**Jessie:** But maybe you could use a bit of 'new' in your life.

**Jeremiah:** (pause)

> You're right.

**Jessie:** After mom died, you wanted everything to stay the same, as
if changing anything

> would dishonour her memory. You entombed yourself in this life, frozen
> from time. But that's not what she would've wanted. She was all about
> change. Change is what drives us to be better. And she was all about
> better.

**Jeremiah:** She was the best of us.

**Jessie:** You were always young at heart, playful, made us laugh. she
loved you for your

> heart, she loved you for your sense of humour, and so did I. You
> didn't like these gizmos and gadgets, but you bought them for her
> anyway.

**Jeremiah:** I did what I could

**Jessie:** But she didn't care about all the toys you bought her. Yes,
she was excited when

> you got them for her, but she just wanted you. And the look on her
> face every time you told her you were leaving\...it broke my heart

**Jeremiah:** I know :( I'm so sorry

**Jessie:** I was mad for the longest time, but this whole death thing,
it really changes you. I

> just wish you could have been there more. That's why I started this
> company. I wasn't trying to get back at you, or hurt you in any way. I
> just wanted to dedicate my life to bringing families together through
> technology. You kept asking me when I'd come to visit; I really really
> wanted to but I couldn't. I was sick for so long. And it's not like
> you were gonna visit me; you\'ve never even been on a plane. I just
> thought that if you could see everyone around you using their iPads,
> skyping their children, that maybe you'd change your mind and skype
> me. I guess it was a long shot.

**Jeremiah:** No! it wasn't! I'm ready to skype you now! stop joking
around.

**Jessie:** I don't want you to feel guilty.

**Jeremiah:** I'm serious

**Jessie:** I know it's hard for you to accept all these changes\...

**Jeremiah:** This isn't funny

**Jessie: \...**but technology isn't the devil. It's not replacing
reality, it's just augmenting it. It's

> here to help us see the beauty of life.

**Jeremiah:** Jessie?

*Jeremiah zones out. sad music*

*We see slideshows of Jessie's life\...as if at a funeral*

*Jeremiah zones back in*

**Jessie:** Anyway\...the funeral's at 6pm. I'd really like it if you
would come. Via live-stream.

*Jeremiah checks his watch*

**Jeremiah:** Oh god!

**Jessie:** I made sure your schedule was free. Just make your hand into
a fist and press

> this button here when it's time and it'll take your straight there.
>
> *Jeremiah presses the button. Suddenly he's at the funeral via live
> stream*

**Jessie:** You might wanna put a suit on. Here.

*He presses a few buttons on his tablet and then pulls a suit out of
nowhere and throws*

> *it on him.*

**Priest:** And now, I've been told that Jessie's father, Jeremiah would
like to say a few

> words via live stream.
>
> *Jeremiah is stunned*

**Jessie:** Go on.

> *Everyone turns to Jeremiah*

**Jeremiah:** They can all see me?

*Jessie nods. Jeremiah walks to the podium*

**Jeremiah:** Uhh\...hmm. Well, thank you for having me. Um\...I really
don't know what to say. I

> know you've all had months to plan this event, but I only just found
> out about any
>
> of it.
>
> This is my first time "live streaming"
>
> *Jeremiah starts getting emotional, some of the song is spoken*

**Jeremiah:** I had a chance to see my son,

> For 7 years I've had a chance to see him
>
> But I didn't know what he had done
>
> I didn't understand
>
> (so) I turned my back on him
>
> I thought this skype was just a trick
>
> To get him out of coming down to visit me
>
> I\'ve been a fool, I've been so thick
>
> And I've missed out on all these golden moments
>
> But he would not give up
>
> Not even on a stubborn man like me
>
> And he spent all his life
>
> making it possible for working men like me to be
>
> Together with their families no matter where they are
>
> That's why he made all this bizarre technology
>
> It was all for me
>
> But I just couldn't see
>
> And now I've missed my only chance to be
>
> With Jessie
>
> My Jessie
>
> I'm sorry
>
> Forgive me
>
> Give me
>
> My dear Jessie
>
> So if you care for my son, then honor his work
>
> Light a candle or maybe a screen

> You must persuade the devil in your heart to go away.

> These miracle wonders have broken the chain

> Technology is here to stay.

*They bury Jessie.*

*Alicia is there. She comforts him. Suddenly she feels faint and
collapses.*

**Jeremiah**: Ali-cat?

*Jeremiah rips off his glasses. He is disoriented*

**SCENE X**

*Jeremiah rushes into Alicia's room. She is surrounded by nurses.*

**Jeremiah**: Ali-cat! what's wrong with her? :o

**Alicia:** I'm getting old that's what's wrong. It could be anything

**Jeremiah:** You're gonna be alright

**Alicia:** I don't know, Jeremiah.

**Jeremiah:** Don't say that! You're gonna be alright. I'm not gonna let
you go.

**Alicia:** It's not up to you. What if I'm ready?

**Jeremiah:** Stop it! no you're not

**Alicia:** Will you stop telling me how to feel?

*Pause*

**Jeremiah:** Aren't you afraid to die?

**Alicia:** Afraid to die? there's at least 20 different machines in
this room that look like

> they're from another planet. I don't recognise my face in the mirror,
> everything hurts, and I miss my Henry. What've I got to be afraid of?
> I've got nothing to lose.

**Jeremiah:** What about me?

*Jeremiah is sad*

**Alicia:** Oh Jeremiah. Come here, you.

You've had such a great life.

I know all of this seems overwhelming; it has been for me too. But I-

*Pause.*

Think about why we go to funerals\...about how much love there is in the
air

You've spent so long being afraid you've forgotten to appreciate what
you've

> had. What you have. Do you really wanna get so old that you can't
> remember your family\...or who you are? that's what you should be
> afraid of, not dying. I don't know what's out there, but I'm not
> wasting whatever time I have left being afraid. I'm not the first
> person to die, and I'm sure as hell not the last. Maybe I'll end up at
> the pearly gates, or maybe I'll come back as a butterfly, or, you
> know, maybe I won't. But either way, when the time comes, I want my
> bags packed and ready to go.

**Jeremiah:** I'm gonna miss you :(

**Alicia:** No you're not. You're comin' with me. I'll see you on the
other side. Go pack your

> bags. Don't leave it until the last minute. Do what you need to do.

**SCENE X**

*We see the end of jeremiah's funeral.*

**Priest:** And now, Jeremiah is gonna say a few words at his own
funeral, through a virtual

> reality recording.

*Jeremiah gets out of the coffin*

**Jeremiah:** Thank you all for coming to my funeral. It means a lot to
me.

SONG

**Jeremiah:** I've always been afraid to die

> I've been avoiding it for many years now
>
> But thinking back I don't know why
>
> The things I loved the most have had their time and gone
>
> But it doesn't have to feel so sad
>
> It doesn't have to feel like they abandoned me
>
> They carry with me in my heart
>
> Whenever I remember to be grateful
>
> (spoken) Grateful. Jessie. Sweet pea. Alicia. All you fine people.
> Thank you for being a part of my life. You always brought out the best
> in me. Pushed me beyond all my limits.

*X enters*

**X:** Jeremiah! have you heard about this new cryogenic freezing thing?

**Jeremiah:** I'm recording my funeral here!

X looks at the audience

**X:** Hey there! :)

(to jeremiah) it's this new thing where they freeze you, and you can
come back

> when you're ready. you can pretty much live forever
>
> ONE by one all the cast come in and do a blooper bit, live :)
>
> So if you care for yourself, then honor your life
>
> Share a memory, don't wait til you die
>
> Take a photo, or film it, or facebook it, tweet!
>
> For god's sake do whatever it takes not to repeat my mistake,
>
> Make those arrangements before it's too late.\
> Don't be afraid.
>
> You must persuade, the devil in your heart to go away.
>
> Your life may be changing but you don't need the fear
>
> Not with gratitude on your side
>
> You can kick and scream and pout all you like
>
> But someday you're gonna die

**THE END**

Jeremiah wants to live forever but needs to learn that death is a part
of life.

OR

Jeremiah wants things to stay the same, but need to accept that change
is a part of life.

**INTERACTIVITY IDEAS**

\- a specific color that represents technology taking over\...maybe
later when j puts on the 3d goggles the colors transforms\...

\- stage the show as a funeral for Jeremiah. We see a video of his life
(acted out live, with a film crew following the actor, in the actual old
folks home). Whenever Jeremiah enters a funeral scene, he walks into the
room with the audience and they all flashback

\- record audience talking about what their parents mean to them at the
start of the show, and play a montage at the end

\- A scene that's pretend outdoors, and the audience puts visors on\...a
little show bag with all the things they need for the show

**TECHNOLOGY THAT HAPPENS**

\- resident counting steps vs a step counter

\- iPads instead of medical history "with my fat finger" ... not being
able to see buttons

\- jeremiah doesn't have email...

\- state of the art skype room for skyping family

\- iPods

\- Calendar reminder "my paper calendar is always there" "that's space
age"

\- pill dispenser

\- People fighting over what to watch on tv

\- e-cigarettes (nobody takes smokos anymore...)

\- bionic prosthetics

\- cooking machine\...divides donuts into 7 equal parts so there's
enough for everyone

\- iPad scrabble

\- pedometer "ohp! 950 steps. Gotta go walk around the car park" (before
bed)

-   Panasonic smart mirror!!

**MOTIFS**

-   Son calling

-   blackouts

-   technology replacing people and things

**PLOT**

\- a volunteer who plays cards with them and secretly gambles with them
making a profit

\- an over-enthusiastic activities director

\- A patient who always thinks she's going home when her family come to
visit\...technology: she always wears the goggles and feels like she IS
at home.

\- one of the old people not recognising their son because he's shaved.

\- People taking selfies at the funeral

\- Jeremiah goes to funerals to hear the beautiful sad songs \... Takes
selfies with the performers on a disposable camera. When technology
takes over, his camera breaks, and someone buys him a digital one. Maybe
a scene where he reminisces over photos? Play them during his funeral

\- are you going to \_\_\_? Nah, you know how long the catholic ones
are\...I might pop in for the wake.

\- Everyone leaves Jeremiah skype messages when he's in the hospital but
he doesn't read them until later

\- "who wants a date with death?"

**QUOTES**

-   "those politicians should be getting on this thing" (snapchat)

-   "this looks like my hearing aid" "how do I sign in without a pen?"
    > (google glass)

-   "I gotta put my glasses on"

-   "I hate that\...it hits the wrong key\...my fingers are too big"
    > (typing on iphone)

-   "We've had to start serving stir-fry and taco salads in the dining
    > room, and I have residents who come in with iPads and cell phones
    > who listen to rock 'n' roll and hip-hop music."

-   "We don't use the word facility, we're a community. We don't have a
    > dietary department, we have a dining services department. And
    > instead of units, we have neighborhoods."

-   They're on top of it, so it's not scary for them.

**QUESTIONS**

-   are there volunteers at the home? maybe they can be the gateway to
    > technology

-   what's j's relationship with his son?

    -   His son calls him all the time

        -   he's trying to tell him that he's dying, but J is always too
            > busy

    -   Was he a good father?

        -   he was a fun father

    -   what's j's relationship with his wife

        -   she's dead. he was really in love with her.

        -   he talks to her picture

        -   maybe someone makes him a 3D version of her picture?

    -   Jesse works in technology, is always trying to convince j to get
        > into technology

        -   your son says he's set you up a skype account, he wants you
            > to call

    -   jesse is an ( anonymous?) benefactor to the nursing home, giving
        > them all their new technology

    -   

\- What's J's relationship with death? is he afraid?

\- Does Jeremiah die??

> \- how does this affect the messages?

\- the importance of accepting death as a change that will happen

\- how will audiences react to jeremiah loving his wife AND being a
player

-   show more technology taking over

-   how do the blackouts work?

    -   every blackout he has a convo with death?

    -   

-   Who is death

    -   comforting

    -   seductive? (not sexually)

    -   resembles a younger version of his dead wife?

    -   pros and cons list...?

    -   does death speak?

**LINES**

**Alicia:** what made the good old days so good anyway?

**\...**

**X:** You're not a traveller

**Jeremiah:** I'm a traveller. I've been to 23 counties!

**\...**

**Jeremiah:** You know why I love funerals? because they never change.
And they're full of

> love. Nobody ever says bad things about you at a funeral. I don't give
> a crap about the food

Song: what happened to the gold old days?

they've come and gone, just change your ways

What's the hype with that skype

What the hook with that facebook

iPhone, and iChat

iThis and iThat

Is it just another play on that tweet thing that's been going on

Codeine for pain, Lasix (diahrretic) \...overdose on laxitive (i dont
wanna shit all over the floor)

"paying bills over and over\...did I pay that bill already?" "push this
button and push that button"

**Jeremiah:** I had to pretend I was a very religious roman catholic, or
she wouldn't let me near

> her

**\...**

**Nurse:** You can't fart without this phone tracking what you're doing.

"the remote control... I can push this button, and I can get the news,
but I know what all these buttons do"

"3D TV? what the hell is that? I grew up in a generation where there was
none of this shit\...we had a black and white tv and clicker\...none of
these fancy buttons that do god knows what"

Old people get old when they stop accepting the changes that are
happening

jeremiah romancing someone with apple juice instead of champagne and the
last desert\
"I scored the last cream pie\...you wanna cream pie"# \... Jeremiah
blacks out

...

A sequence about pills and side-effects

did you take your \_\_\_.

Yeah but that makes me constipated

well did you eat your prunes

Yeah etc.

\...

**RELATED IDEAS**

-   ways for the audience to view video interviews\...maybe as promo
    > material\...a blog?

-   a computer game?

    -   you play as the elderly trying to overthrow technology?

    -   a game about how people remember things differently? how does
        > that change with alzheimer\'s and dementia?

    -   

-   Drive through funerals

-   Old person perfume

-   Alicia OR sweet pea going to "Feminism classes" and Jeremiah feeling
    > threatened

1)  **jeremiah is feeling overwhelmed by change and death and is pissed
    > off**

2)  **going through stages\...resisting...**

3)  **alicia telling him he's making it difficult for himself**

4)  **conversation with his son**

5)  **2nd half stronger?? or just because it's getting into the flow of
    > reading.**

**beginning is kinda funny\...j's a geezer, sexually active\...minor
interactions with different people**

**when you think about your life\...holly watched funeral online\...it
would freeze every now and then... this feels so weird...**

**A twist on a coming of age story\...if at the end of your
life\...you're accepting all that life is about and your experience and
the end.**
