My body knows when something's wrong,
My body knows when it's time to go,
My body knows when I don't trust you
My body knows, my body knows

And I just have to listen, and relax
And I just have to trust in all the facts

My body is a temple and i worship everyday
And every time listen it's got helpful things to say
Its tell me who I am and who to trust and what to do
Dear body, I'm alive because of you

My body knows when it don't feels right,
My body knows when I should leave your sight
My body knows when to fight or flight,
My body knows, my body knows

My body knows when to trust a stranger,
My body knows when I'm in danger
My body knows, it's my guardian angel,
my body knows, my body knows

And I just have to listen, and relax
And I just have to trust in all the facts

My body is a temple and i worship everyday
And every time listen it's got helpful things to say
Its tell me who I am and who to trust and what to do
Dear body, I'm alive because of you
