Set in "The Food Chain", a restaurant for carnivores, which operates
like a production line. The chefs all live there, and Fritz has never
left the food chain

Animals can talk, Poultry can't talk (or can they? :o )

**PRELUDE**

>*The audience are at a restaurant. a cute bunny rabbit puppet is one of the waiters. S/he improvises banter with audience members. When the show is ready to start, s/he offers* *to tell a story.*

**Narrator:** 
This is the story of Fritz the Fox. You see, there was a restaurant called the Food Chain where big scary carnivores would cook cute little herbivores, and there was a Fox whose name was Fritz, and he was- well, I guess you'll find out soon enough.These were dark times, and there was a lot of fear going round, and none of the animals at the food chain were allowed outside, because it was far too dangerous. But inside at the Food Chain they were safe. So they spent their whole lives indoors. Anyway, Fritz, he was a good fox, a great chef, followed all the rules, but then one day something happened.

But you're just chickens

Just chickens?! So, what, you think we want to die?

**Chaniqua:** 
-so you just closed your eyes and chopped our heads off.
Murderer.

I always knew you meat eaters were vicious, I didn't realise
you were stupid too.

Time to become a soup, or something.

Oh, what. you're just gonna let us go? this soup's just gonna
make itself then?

**Fritz:** 
I'm not a killer.

**Chase:** 
Ha.

**Fritz:** 
I-

**Chaniqua**: 
You keep telling yourself that.

I promise. I'll make it up to you.

Don't bother.
