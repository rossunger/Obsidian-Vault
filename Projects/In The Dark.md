**SciFi story 1**

*First we reached too far. Then we didn't reach at all. Our doom was a
slow and ponderous one, borne of complacency. We made such great strides
that it seemed we were unbound by even natural laws. Even so, we were
making our own downfall, by our own hand.*

**Jared:** I love your latest chapter. I'm not usually a fan of
dystopian novels, but I think

**Jo:** Thanks. I'm working on this bit right now about the machine and

**Jared:** It's so true. And scary. Isolating.

**Jo:** Yeah, I feel that. Thank god for this forum. Nobody else seems
to care about

**Jared:** I know! I just wish we weren't all so far away from each
other

**Jo:** Me too! What's Bolivia like?

**Jared:** Don't know, I've never been

**Jo:** My computer says you're in Bolivia?

**Jared:** I'm using a proxy

**Jo:** Oh. Me too. Haha

**Jared:** So you're not really in Latvia?

**Jo:** Nah, I'm in Canada

**Jared:** Oh. Me too.

**Jo:** Where in Canada?

**Jared:** Halifax

**Jo:** \... me too.

**Jo:** I'm surprised I've never met you. Where do you hang out?

**Jared:** I don't really leave the house much.

**Jo:** Why not?

**Jared:** I don't really like people. They don't really get me

**Jo:** I know what you mean. I get you.

**Jared: ...** (erases his text)

**Jo:** Do you want to hang out sometime?

**Jared:** I don't know

**Jo:** Oh. ok.

**Jared:** I just don't want to get my hopes up.

**Flint:** Why would you say that?? Thank god you didn't send that. You

***SCI-FI STORY 1.5***

*We defeated everything that menaced us, but with that we took away
anything to drive us. All the concerns of a society; disappeared with
nary a thought to the cost. We were then free to turn our attentions
elsewhere; first to frivolous pursuits, and eventually even away from
that.*

**Scene 2 - Elevator scene**

> *Jared and Flint catch the elevator. Jared sighs*

**Flint:** Long day?

**Jared:** The usual

> *Pause*

**Flint:** So, got any plans for Christmas? Are you seeing your family?

**Jared:** I don\'t really have any.

**Flint:** Roommates?

**Jared**: I live alone

**Flint:** Thats terrible! Why don\'t you come to our house for
Christmas dinner?

**Jared:** Nah. I don\'t really celebrate Christmas.

**Flint:** You don\'t have to celebrate. We do all the religious-y stuff
in the morning. This

> will just be a dinner

**Jared:** Well, also, I'm vegetarian.

**Flint:** We've already reserved a Soy Turkey but there weren't enough
cranberries to

> go around

**Jared:** That's ok. I don't like cranberries anyway. But, will there
be lots of people?

**Flint:** I hope so.

**Jared:** I\'m not great with people

**Flint:** ooookay.

> *Elevator stops suddenly.*

**Flint:** Ah! Oh gosh! It just stopped. Why'd it stop, why'd it stop?
Should I try calling

> someone? WHY IS THERE NO CELL SERVICE? I'm feeling a little
> claustrophobic. I think I need to sit down. Are we going to die?

**Jared:** No, elevators are built with a lock system that protects them
from falling if

> they ever break down.

**Flint:** Ok. You can do this, you can do this. you can do this.
Breathe in and out.

> Why is it so hard to breathe? Can you talk to me? Just say anything.
> tell me a story or something.

**Bluefish:** I'm not really good at talking. I have an audio book?

> *Flint grabs the headphones*

**SCI-FI STORY 2**

*The first steps, darkly prophetic, were when we stopped learning and
creating, spending our time in contemplation. With machines to do all of
the work, not a single threat to us remained. It was a new reality, but
it would yet take some time to show it's apocalyptic ways.*

*We had long-passed a point of no return, few among us even noticing,
when the machines began to manage our choices for us. Even the most
trivial of decisions were made for us; what we would eat, what we would
buy, how we would live, what we would learn. These things, and more,
chosen to maximise the efficiency of this new machine, a machine that we
had once called civilization.*

**Flint:** Thanks for that. It was really soothing. It reminded me of my
cousin. He used

> to read to me when were kids. He always looked after me. I was a
> little troublemaker and he was always the serious one. You know, if it
> wasn't for him, I don't know where I'd be right now. The funny thing
> is, I've never told him that. I've never said thank you. It's strange
> how we forget to thank the people who are closest to us.
>
> *Time passes. Flint starts praying.*

**Flint:** Please let the power come back on. It's been a long week and
we've had so

> many storms like this recently. Poor Jared has it hard enough as it
> is, he just wants to get home. And I have to help mom and dad with
> holiday decorating. And you know I don't like small spaces, is this
> some kind of punishment? Oh please bring the power back so we can get
> out of here.

**Jared:** Does that normally help you?

**Flint:** I don't know, Jared. Sometimes it just feels like I do that
because there's

> nothing else to do. I'm not sure I've been a good believer, recently.

**Jared:** Sounds confusing. What do you mean?

**Flint:** I guess it's just been hard being myself lately.

**Jared:** That doesn't make any sense. If you're not yourself, who are
you?

**Flint:** Me. I mean, just not the right me. But I don't know which me
is the right me.

**Jared:** Ok....

**Flint:** I don't know why I just told you that. I feel like I can talk
to you.

**Jared:** I feel like I can talk to you too. You're one of the only
people that doesn't treat

> me like a stranger, or the token blind guy.

**Flint:** I guess you're the only one who doesn't treat me like a girl

**Jared:** I wasn't sure if you were. And I don't think it's that
important?

**Flint:** No, it's not. Thanks for saying that. Can i tell you
something I've never told

> anyone before?

**Jared:** Sure.

**Flint:** I think I like everyone. Well not everyone. But like whoever.
I don't care if it's a

> guy or a girl

**Jared:** Me too

**Flint:** No, I mean, like, when I'm into someone. I think I'm
pansexual.

**Jared:** Oh. Ok. So what's the problem?

**Flint:** Well, I'm christian. And all my friends are christian.

**Jared:** And?

**Flint:** Well, they're not really supportive of that. In fact they're
pretty homophobic.

> So I want to be truly myself, and I want people to like me, and my
> faith is really important to who I am. And I think people are
> beautiful, and I can't control who I'm attracted to, it just happens.

**Jared:** I think I should tell you a story. I don't share it that
often, because it's a terrible

> story. And it involves talking. Besides, we could be stuck in here for
> a while. It was ten years ago. I used to be a gamer, back when I could
> see. I played lots of different video games- RPGs, strategy games,
> shooters\.... I was known across the web as Bluefish, my starcraft
> avatar.

**Flint:** What's so terrible about that?

**Jared:** Just wait. The attack happened at Comi-con. The place was
packed. Tens of

> thousands of people dressed up as their favourite videogame and comic
> book characters. It was chaos in there, with huge screens everywhere,
> and loud music. Everyone was having a blast. But suddenly, the power
> went out. In those days power outages were less common, and people
> didn't really know what to do. Since I worked as an electrician-

**Flint:** You worked as an electrician back then?

**Jared:** yes - so I knew where to find the circuit panel. I weaved my
way through the

> people and found the control room. The door was locked so I kicked the
> door down.

**Flint:** You kicked the door down!?!!?

**Jared:** Of course. When I got inside, it was obvious that someone had
cut the power

> intentionally. It didn't take me long to get the power back on. As I
> made my way back through the crowds, I remember everyone was relieved,
> and had such huge smiles on their faces, happy to be a part of a group
> of people who felt just like them. They were dressed not as
> themselves, but as someone else, someone they wanted desperately to
> be. A more true version of their inner selves, free from their
> everyday life. I often think how beautiful it was. In part, because it
> was the last thing I ever saw.

**Flint:** What happened?

**Jared:** I found myself on the ground with blood all over my hands. I
learned later that

> someone had come up behind me and stabbed me in the eyes. I didn't see
> them, and they were never found. Some other people there saw two
> people running away from the scene, but there were thousands of people
> dressed up with knives and daggers and swords, so my attackers escaped
> before the police arrived. I think they were staging a robbery or
> something, and my putting the power back on foiled their plans.

**Flint:** I can't believe I've never asked you that before. Why didn't
you say

> something!? Do other people know this story?

**Jared:** I don't tell it much, because it's very painful for me.

*Pause*

**Jared:** Hm maybe it's an internal problem, where's the control panel.

**Flint:** Don't electrocute yourself, what are you doing??

*Doors open!*

**Jared:** Emergency release valve

**Flint:** You\'re just full of surprises

**Jared:** I\'ll see you on Monday

**Scene 3 - Friend Date @ Restaurant**

> *Restaurant. Jared arrives.*

**Jo:** Oh. I didn\'t realise you were blind

**Jared:** Is that a problem?

**Jo:** No. I just... Never thought about it

**Jared:** Most people don\'t.

> *(Pause)*

**Jo:** Are you hungry? Here's the menu, They just upgraded to the new

> tablet-server app and it's delightful. Oh, ah maybe they have one in

**Jared:** It's a common misconception that all blind people read
braille.

**Jo:** So they don't?

**Jared:** No

**Jo:** oh

**Jared:** But I do. What's good here?

**Jo:** I think they\'re down to just a variety of salad greens. Last
time I was here they

> had tomato too, but it looks like it\'s just lettuce and Kale now.
> I\'m going to have the iceberg. It was satisfactory during my last
> visit.

**Jared:** What\'s the cheapest?

**Jo:** it looks like Kale

**Jared:** Eugh. I\'ll just have water

**Jo:** What kind of water would you like? They have different vintages.
I'd say the

> '79 sparkling mineral water is my favourite.

**Jared:** I'll just have tap water.

**Jo:** You can have some of my iceberg if you like.

**Jared:** That would be nice.

(Pause)

**Jared:** so what are some of your interests?

**Jo:** Oh good question. well, I like sci-fi, but you already know
that. I don\'t know.

> I\'m a bit weird\...I like to read books and drink black coffee?

**Jared:** That\'s not that unusual.

**Jo:** Right. What about you?

**Jared:** I listen to audio books

> *(Pause)*

**Jo:** So, have you always had...your\... blindness

**Jared:** No.

> *(Pause)*

**Jo:** Fair enough.

> *(Pause)*

**Jo:** Look I don\'t really do....' this'. I don\'t know how to be a
good friend. All my

> friends from school just wanted to drink box wine and party....
>
> They thought I was a bit of a snob so I kept to myself and I don\'t
> really know how to do this whole "in-person" thing very well.

**Jared:** Maybe we could go back to texting?

**Jo:** Ok

> *Texting*

**Jo:** it\'s kinda nice to be in the same room

**Jared:** yes.

**Jo:** by the way, my cousin\'s family is hosting an annual christmas
party, you

> should come

**Jared:** I don\'t really celebrate Christmas

**Jo:** Me neither. I just eat the food and find a quiet corner to do
some writing. My

> family is important to me but I avoid feeding into consumerist traps

**Jared:** I don't really like people. No offense. I mostly stick to
myself.

**Jo:** I don\'t think many people will come this year because of the
storm

**Jared:** Oh. ok. That doesn't sound too bad.

**Jo:** It's not. Hey, I hope this isn't too intrusive, but I was
looking reading an article

**Jared:** No thank you.

**Jo:** What? Why not?

**Jared:** I don't want to talk about it.

**Jarod:** I can't afford it and it's really not something I'm

**Jo:** But\...You could have a chance to see-

**Jarod:** I knew this was a bad idea

**Jo:** I'm just trying to help

**Jarod:** I didn't ask for you help

**Jo**: Does this mean you're not coming to dinner?

**Jared:** No I'll still come.

**SCI-FI STORY SCENE 3**

*If there was a single deathblow, it was the loss of intellectual
pursuits. Why learn anything when you don't have to? Why not just do
what the machines tell you, optimized for your own comfort. With this,
we became but window dressings in a new society. A society without life
as we know it; a grand automation.*

*We had held the key to it all in the palm of our hands; we had all the
answers, and all the solutions. Then, we gave it away to a machine, and
the machine told us what to do with ourselves. It was a ponderous,
meandering apocalypse, but an apocalypse nonetheless.*

**Scene 4 - Final Dinner**

> *Xmas Dinner time at the Locks residence.*

**Flint**: Well. Looks like there's nobody coming. What a shame.

**Jo**: Wish I could say I didn't expect this. I guess this is what
happens

**Flint:** Jared! What\'re you doing here? I mean, come in! I'm so happy
you decided to

> come! We were just saying that we didn\'t think anyone was coming and
> what a waste of food that would be and now here you are.

**Jared:** Yes

**Flint:** Merry Christma- Happy holidays! How are you? How was your
weekend?

**Jared:** Good

**Flint:** What have you been up to?

**Jared:** Not much

*(pause)*

**Jared:** I think I made a new friend

**Flint:** That\'s fantastic! Who are they? Tell me about them!

> *Enter Jo*

**Jo:** You made it

**Flint:** You two know each other? Wait, This is the friend??

**Jo:** Good to see you.

**Jared:** I wish I could say the same.

*Pause*

> Relax, it's a joke.

**Jo:** I suppose, yes. Good of you to come. It's been terrible out

**Flint** That's what happens when you're nice to someone, they show up.
Even when

> it's hard.

**Jared:** When are we eating?

> *The 3 sit down at a table.*

**Flint:** So, how do you two know each other?

**Jo:** Well like most of my friendships, we met online.

**Jared:** I don't usually meet people in person but I like his books.

**Flint:** He never lets me read his writing.

**Jared:** I have all the audiobooks. That\'s what I played you in the
elevator

**Flint:** I knew that voice sounded familiar.

**Jo:** So how do you two know each other?

**Flint**: We work in the same building. And we got stuck in an elevator
together the

> other day.

**Jared:** So I\'ve been thinking more about the surgery

**Flint:** You\'re gonna get it?

**Jared:** It's just too expensive

**Jo**: You\'re going to go through life blind because you can\'t afford
surgery?

**Jared:** I guess

**Jo:** No. I'm sorry. I can't accept that. There's gotta be something
you can do.

> What about a fundraiser?

**Jared:** I don't know any people.

**Flint:** What about all your forum buddies? They'd probably throw you
a ten-er?

**Jared:** I'd need a lot more than that.

**Jo:** (to flint) I'm sure your church would help.

**Jared:** I don't know

**Flint:** And you can finish making your damn book and sell it.

**Jared:** That would probably help

**Jo:** And you can stop pretending that you're straight and tell all
your friends what

> you really think of their bigoted ways
>
> *(Pause)*

**Flint:** Alright. If you sell you book and donate all the money to
make this surgery

> happen I will come out to all of our friends and family

**Jo:** And the church

**Flint:** And the church

**Jo:** Deal.

**Flint:** What just happened.

**Jo:** I don't know, but it feels great. We should celebrate!

> *The prime minister comes on TV.*

**TV:**

I apologise for this interruption, but what I have to say could not
wait.

Many of you may have noticed changes to the delicate ecosystems that we
share with all life on earth. For thousands of years humankind has lived
in harmony with the world around us, nature keeping the delicate balance
of life in check. Well, in the last thousand years, humanity has pushed
it to the limits. We have made great discoveries, achieved more than we
ever thought possible. But like the fable of Icarus, we have flown too
close to the sun, and now are wings are charred and we are plummeting.

Today we have reached a point of no return. Global warming is upon us,
and there is no turning back. We have failed to meet the 2 degree margin
by a long shot, and all the science points to doom. The time for
equivocating is long past. It does not matter whether you believe this
climate change is man made or not, we have all seen it's effects and
they are only getting worse. Safe to say, this is the end of life as we
know it. But it does not have to mean extinction.

You may very well be the last generation to see life on Earth, but there
is life beyond this planet, and that is why I am addressing you now. I
am calling a state of international emergency to address the survival of
the human race. I am proposing a global cooperation in preparing for
life after Earth. Let us use these final years to create a plan for the
future, ensuring that there are safeguards so that we do not repeat our
mistakes.

While I am optimistic about our future, it would be dishonest of me to
say that I am not afraid. We are all afraid. There is no avoiding that.
There is a clear and present danger, and the outcome should we fail is
truly dastardly. But let us not succumb to chaos. We must stand strong,
united. This is not a time for hate, or violence. The stakes are much
too high. And I promise you, if we all work together, we can make it out
of this alive.

If this disaster has taught me anything it is to appreciate the things
you have. I would suggest you take the time to reflect upon your lives.
Embrace your loved ones, if you are so lucky as to have some. Think
about how you'd like to spend humanity's final years on earth. Think
"how can I be part of the solution". It's not over yet. We have a lot of
work to do. In the words of the great \_\_\_ \*insert quote here\*.

Kyle's Writings:

First we reached too far. Then we didn't reach at all. Our doom was a
slow and ponderous one, borne of complacency. We made such great strides
that it seemed we were unbound by even natural law. We made our own
downfall, by our own hand.\
\
We defeated everything that menaced us, but with that we took away
anything to drive us. Thus free of any concerns, we turned our
attentions to frivolous pursuits, and eventually we went beyond that.\
\
The first steps were when we stopped learning and creating, spending our
time in relaxed contemplation. With machines to do all of the work, and
not a single threat to us left, it took some time to show it's
apocalyptic ways.\
\
We had long-passed a point of no return when the machines began to
manage even our choices for us. Decisions started to be made for us;
what we would eat, how we would vote, what we would learn, each chosen
to maximize efficiency.\
\
The deathblow was the loss of intellectual pursuits. Why learn anything
when you don't have to? Why not just do what the machines tell you,
optimized for your own comfort. With this, we became but window
dressings in a new society. A society without life as we know it.\
\
We had held the key to it all in the palm of our hands; we had all the
answers, and all the solutions. Then, we gave it away to a machine, and
the machine told us what to do with ourselves. It was a ponderous,
meandering apocalypse, but an apocalypse nonetheless.

    > She stood, watching the car pull closer, her expression contorted
    > with silent rage. He pulled past, obviously ignoring her, any
    > chance for an apology long-gone. She, for her part, lit an M80
    > with a slow-burning fuse, and threw it into his exhaust pipe as he
    > pulled past.
