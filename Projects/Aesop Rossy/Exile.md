![[Exile2.m4a]]
My friendships duly dulled by losses 
to restrictive kindship clauses 
caused me catastrophic consequences, 
and citing fatal flaws for sentences 
I found myself contempted, 
says the jury to the arbiter: 
this house is full, it's far fitter 
for this fowl to forfeit furtive fences 
than expect us lower our defenses,
hence, there's nothing left to do 
but send them to the outskirts of our forking friend group,

thus unceremoniously relegated, 
I'm abandoned by my delegates
and my Disfunctional disentanglement 
from disingenuous degenerates 
promptly turns a sweet taste sour 
as the power that I abdicate 
leaves a void apt to eradicate 
the foundational sensation 
that bore the burgeoning of my creation, 
all the blood and sweat and tears I tried to 
trade for transcendentalism, 
but the trauma is generational, 
so I fixate on the irrational, 
and I break from the traditional, 
and this phase is just transitional,Â
