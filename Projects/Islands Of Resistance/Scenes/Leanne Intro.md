[[Leanne]] threw a cloak over her cocktail dress and prepared to go. After a
night of serving strangers she was ready to be at home relaxing in a sun
bath. She loved working in a queer bar, but the secrecy and sneaking
around that was required was starting to wear her out

She donned her hood and stepped cautiously into the street. again feel
like anyone was following her few could never be sure.she did the usual
loop around, popping into random establishments and then hopped on the
[[55 bus]].

In her head she played the story over and over again, what she would say
if anybody asked her. She wasn\'t used to being an agent of change and
sometimes she wasn\'t sure if her memories were truth or fiction. Did I
kill him? I don\'t know. Was I even there? its hard to say for certain.
If you doubt yourself enough times you can plausible deny the truth.

"Are you that kid who killed the [[Sun King]]?"

"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about"

"You look just like her"

"I\'m not her"

"I thought you didn\'t know what I was talking about?"

"I don\'t. I\'m just reading between the lines."

"Maybe I should call the police"

"Fuck off"

The scenario kept playing in her head. She wasn\'t sure why. She was
pretty sure she didn\'t do it. It\'s just not who she was. Although, she
did have access to her daddy\'s files, and she could have stolen
sensitive information. But wouldn\'t she remember doing that? That\'s
the part that bothered her the most. She remembered almost everything.
How could she forget something so enormous? and yet still, she felt
uneasy. Guilty almost.

The [[upper levels]] do a pretty good job of curbing teenage rebellious
phases, but Leanne happened to be a fringe case. For some reason none of
the programming stuck. Leanne had a sneaking suspicion that it had
something to do with a childhood encounter that she couldn't quite
remember, but she couldn't say for sure. A hooded figure, clandestine
words, just a vague memory. Ever since then she's felt a calling, like
there was something more that this sterile life laid out before her.

Leanne got off the bus at the [[vertical terminal]] and presented her ID.
She never quite got used to having her eyes scanned. Growing up on the
[[upper floors]] didn\'t require validating your existence so explicitly. As
she rode the [[elevator]] to [[suncave 3]] she remembered the first time she\'d
come down here.

A cloaked joker had been running down the hall, with a cheeky grin and a
flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants look in their eye. The shouting in the
distance suggested that they were trouble, which a normal sun-child
would avoid like the plague, but Leanne couldn't help herself. "In
here!" she pulled them into her locker room. The footsteps scurried by.
"Thank you" "Take me with you" "What?" "Take me with you" "Where?"
"Anywhere" "Are you sure?" "Yes" "Let's go"
