![[LoveYourself.mp3]]
I'm craving ravens roosting, 
I'm rudely rioting reacting, 
against the falling of the fantasies, 
resisting, inconsistencies 
in the sentimental twistings 
of the life you used to know and live, 
whereas now you're just a holey sieve

You're giving, grieving, ghostly passages, 
caressing counter-levered policies, 
the politics is torturous, 
but you gotta sit the porch with us, 
no exceptions for the virtuous, 
it's do or die, 
the murder of the you and I, 
release your cosmic burdens, 
so you can live your life in earnest, 
oh, did I mention that it hurts inside? 
Bring attention to what's burned alive, 
you'll be fine once the moisture hits your eye, 
just keep breathing and you might not die

Ok, we're feeling, falling, yearning for the ride to end, 
but life's got other plans instead, 
it keeps accelerating, 
obfuscating all the exit signs, 
140 on the highway lines, 
the mind is bending, mending 
all the pathways that are haunted 
by the tardy handling of the inner childs most deepest wantings, daunting, am I right? 
To fear the feeling of being wanted,
  
well, you gotta learn to love yourself,
Tell your inner kid they're enough, how else will ya
rectify those childhood scolding,
you were given arms, get busy holding,

now a gauntlet of defences 
dances, diligently slicing your attempts 
to heal the wounds you helped invent 
and left to fester, 
you're your own worst chief investigator, 
lacking all the tools 
you seek forensics clues for cancers, 
but only fools seek one word answers 
while digging up the seeds they planted.Â
