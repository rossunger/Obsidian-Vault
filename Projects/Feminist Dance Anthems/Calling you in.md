Dear friend

I am writing to ask if you're ok? Do you need help? The only reason I
ask is because I have been hearing some troubling stories about things
that you have said and done.. I have heard that you\... \*music break\*.

I am calling you in, cos you've done something bad
Not calling you out, Cos I am your friend, I'll be here for you
We all make mistakes, and sometimes it takes
Some help from your friends calling you in, we're calling you in

I was wondering if you were aware of these actions, and how they were
affecting those around you? Maybe something's going on that you'd like
to talk about?
I will be here all night, please come over. I won't judge you.
