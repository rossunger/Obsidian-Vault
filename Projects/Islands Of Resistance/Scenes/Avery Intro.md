[[Avery]] was generally a sweet, kind hearted-human, but something about
sitting in a classroom made them furious. They felt powerless and full
of anxiety. They couldn't quite figure out why. As they raged quietly in
their seat, a man in a suit paraded in front of the class gesticulating
with his hand while delivering an extended tirade about financial
intelligence with intermittent jokes at the expense of the working
class. As far as Avery was concerned he may as well have been saying
"money money money", a topic that made them feel hollow, nay, dead
inside. The thought of sitting through another minute of this, let alone
subjecting themselves to weeks of such classes filled Avery with dread.
