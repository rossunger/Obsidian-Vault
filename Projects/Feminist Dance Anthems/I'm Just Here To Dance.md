I am not your plaything
Stop trying to persuade me
Take your prying eyes
And turn them inside out

Cos I don't know you
And I don't wanna hold your hand
Don't try to spin me
Haven't you heard of consent boy
Ignorance ain't a defense

Can't you see I'm dancing here?
You're fouling up the atmosphere
Boy, get your sexual tension out of here and take your friend with you
Cos you know what?

I'm just here to dance, dance, dance
Get your mind out of my pants
I don't want you there
But I guess just you don't care
I'm gonna make you cry if you touch me one more time
Get your filthy hands
Off my sweet mammary glands
I'm here to dance

You keep pushing for eye contact
Like it's some sort of contract
You can't buy me with your drinks
Or your cunning slippery winks

Can't you see I'm dancing here?
You're fouling up the atmosphere
Boy, get your sexual tension out of here and take your friend with you
Cos you know what?

I'm just here to dance
Get your mind out of my pants
I don't want you there
But I guess you don't care
I'm gonna make you cry if you touch me one more time
Get your filthy hands
Off my sweet mammary glands
I'm here to dance

I move but you just find me
You keep rubbing up behind me
You're gonna make me lose my shit
You wanna see a crazy bitch?

Can't you see I'm dancing here?
You're fouling up the atmosphere
Boy, get your sexual tension out of here and take your friend with you
Cos you know what?

I'm just here to dance
Get your mind out of my pants
I don't want you there
But I guess you don't care
I'm gonna make you cry if you touch me one more time
Get your filthy hands
Off my sweet mammary glands
I'm here to dance
