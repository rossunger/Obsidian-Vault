![[What comes around goes around.m4a]]
What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
Gonna settle up before you're in the ground

Ive been learning what it means to respect your elders
Never trusted 'em before, cos we were disconnected
All my relatives were broken by what life subjected them to
And I couldn't handle it so I rejected them too

What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
I wanna settle up before I'm in the ground

I've been learning what it means to really be authentic
How to value all your gifts and drop the sycophantics
How to listen to your body, not dissect semantics
How to validate your wants and needs without demanding
  
What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
I wanna settle up before I'm in the ground
  
Ive been learning how to carry on when life is blinding
How to balance without feet and keep yourself reminding
That you know what you must do now even though it's grinding
