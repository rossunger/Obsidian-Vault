As she rode in the back of the van, [[Laska]] fiddled with the necklace in
her pocket. What a foolish risk to take. Coming to work for the [[gender division]] everyday masquerading as a man was dangerous enough, if they
found out she was helping refugees god knows what they'd do to her.

Laska had joined the force because they offered to pay her university
tuition, which she couldn't afford after losing her scholarship. At
least that's what she told people if they asked. The real reason she
signed up was because she got caught doing something she wasn't
supposed to, and the [[Dean Jefferson|Dean]] of the university, who knew her father and was
an overall kind and decent human, devised a plan that would save her
from being sentenced to [[gender rehab]]. All she had to do was
lie, and say that the reason she was going around presenting like a
woman was because she was undercover, trying to bait other queers, and
not in fact as an act of protest.

Normally this kind of last ditch attempt fell on deaf ears, but with the
Dean vouching for her she got a pardon and a fast track scholarship to
the gender academy. Of course, she's been under heavy scrutiny ever
since, but after her "heroic arrest" last year things seemed like they
might be calming down.
