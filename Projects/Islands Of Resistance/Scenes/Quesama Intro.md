[[Quesama]] was a wizard. Everyone who met them left feeling like the world
was a little more magical than before. It wasn\'t just the magic tricks,
or the fact that they knew everything about everything, it was a feeling
of wonder and optimism that oozed from their soul. Looking into their
eyes, one couldn't help but feel inspired. They were a wizard.

Quesama had studied spirituality from an early age. Their parents had
been collectors of rare books and the family would often go on long
trips to obscure places to find knowledge keepers to transcribe, or to
join an expedition that had uncovered rare objects. On these trips
Quesama was exposed to all sorts of incredible healers. It seemed like
nobody was afraid to be themselves once they got outside the city. With
little else to do, Quesama read the rare books their parents collected,
and talked to eclectic visionaries who filled their mind with mystical
fragments and endless wonder.
