Intro:

-   Welcome friends. We've been waiting for you. We're so glad you're
    > here.

-   The doorways are opening. It's time. Don't be afraid. We'll be right
    > here with you every step of the way.

-   The journey we are about to embark on transcends time and space,
    > even though this radio program does not. If you get lost along the
    > way, just close your eyes, take 10 deep breaths, go inwards.
    > You've walked this way before, even if you don't remember. Maybe
    > not in this lifetime, maybe not in this timeline. But your spirit
    > knows the way. Trust.

-   We will be making sounds. Together. Your body knows what sounds it
    > needs to make. Don't try to force it. Don't hold it in. Be brave.
    > We really need you. You're beautiful in all your imperfections.
    > The soul has different ways to sing. Not all of them are pretty,
    > but they are all crucial, and we need them now, more than ever

-   To help you in your travels, bring your tools: your stones, your
    > plants, your medicines, your animals. Call upon your ancestors.
    > Your spirit guides. Whatever helps you on the way.

-   We recommend you set intentions. Why are you travelling today? Do
    > you seek answers? Do you pray for peace? To know yourself? Or to
    > accept what is? Your intention is what keeps you grounded. It will
    > help you to reflect. Don't try to force it, but allow it to form
    > in your mind. What are you celebrating? What's needing help?
    > What's laying dormant in your heart? It's ok if you can't hear it
    > yet. Just take a breath, and give it space. It may rise up inside
    > you as you open up yourself.

-   In a moment you will be joining us. Start by taking 3 deep breaths.
    > One. (inhale) If you know it, say it in your head: "my intention
    > is: \_\_". exhale . Two (inhale) place yourself in time and space.
    > The year is 2022. We are in mi'kmaki, land of the mi'kmaq people.
    > (exhale). Whose ancestors have walked this earth for thousands of
    > years. We say msit no\'kmaq. (inhale) All my relations. We
    > acknowledge the spirit of this land. We acknowledge the water.
    > Water is life. We acknowledge all living things. (exhale).
    > Remember to keep breathing.

Outro:

-   This has been Tune in to Toning on CKDU. Our time on radio is up,
    > but please remember that this journey is a way of life. You have a
    > right to make whatever sounds you need.

-   Reflect on your experience. Take time to integrate what you have
    > learned. Keep a journal. Discuss with friends. Continue making
    > sound. Each time it gets a little easier.

-   If you'd like to join us live in person please reach out to \_,
    > otherwise you'll find us here next week at 9.
