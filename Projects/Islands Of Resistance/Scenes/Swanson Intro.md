[[Dr Swanson]] always remained calm in emergencies. It was a gift. From a
young age, they remembered dealing with hysterical adults running around
like headless chooks. Swanson somehow managed to maintain a cool head.

As they pondered the situation in front of them, Swanson observed the
bystanders who were both concerened for the bleeding youth laying here
and frightened of attracting attention from the authorities lest their
little sanctuary become a target of the next Raid. Every few weeks the
[[King of Q]] would send a squad of Gender detectives or some other
insidious officials to terrorise some poor village and set an example
for the masses.

SWANSON
You did the right thing to call me. This is a unique injury, and requires carefully attention. Did you tell anyone else about this?

ULA
No

SWANSON
Good. Do you have somewhere we can take them?

ULA 
No. I don't even know them

SWANSON
Where are we? I think I have a friend...ok let's go. Also, I'm going to need some supplies. Do you think you can find these things?

Swanson took the nod as a yes and hurried to pick up the bleeding
adolescent. 

SWANSON 
You're going to be ok. I'm going to take you to a safe place and we're gonna sew up the open wounds, and then I'm gonna take a look and make sure there's no internal damage, ok?

Swanson wasn't sure if this was a hate crime or a botched operation, but the thought of either made them really mad.

SWANSON
What's your name kid?

ALI
Ali

SWANSON
I need you to take these. They're gonna make it feel a little better and help with the bleeding. When's the last time you had Sun?

ALI
2 weeks

SWANSON
Dammit. You've been saving up haven't you?

ALI
They said it would be painless. Over in 12 hours

SWANSON
I'm so sorry kid. Here, put this on. I can't operate until your Sun count reaches 13. You're not allergic to anything?

ALI
I get Sun spots on my arms, but that's it I think

SWANSON
That's just the toxins they dump in the air here. How long have you lived here?

ALI
My whole life

SWANSON
You were born here? That's rough

ALI
Doc, is it bad?

SWANSON
I don't know yet.

ALI
If I die, can you throw me in the [[river]]? I don't want the others to have to deal with me

SWANSON
You're not gonna die. I've got you

Ula burst in with supplies. 

SWANSON
You got everything on the list?

ULA
No. I couldn't find any of the organics. But I got replicas?

SWANSON
It'll have to do. Well done. Sun count...12. almost ready to go. Clear the table. Make sure nobody comes in."
