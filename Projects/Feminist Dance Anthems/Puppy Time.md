I don't know how else to say it's puppy time!

Stop raise your eyes up
The beauty of the sound is about to erupt
The stage
Is the place to be
With fresh kind feels and curiosities
So How many times to you turn and look
For a life saving world winning kinda book
Truth but full of lies and some that you really need to buy
So up and down to the stage
Grab your friends and relatives
Leave the haze
I'm here you're here too
What kinda world could we lead you to
The seperate? indivdual kind?
The one where that stranger has a mega strong vibe
The one where the flow that never lets go
Rides you out and takes control
The heart is made a new
With pumping hard beats of age old truths
With light and love synchronized flooding rushing writing time
Leading with the way you wanna be nothing left that you gotta to be
Hear us now you're so fine
Everybody stop
Its Puppy time
