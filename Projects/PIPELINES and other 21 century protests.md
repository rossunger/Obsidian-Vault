Sahara: -I\'ve spoke with a new friend of mine the other day who happens
to be a writer and is involved in theatre/the film industry. He said
he'd be willing to lend a hand! After talking with him a bit more, I can
maybe add him to the group? I\'m also meeting with someone else on
Monday who has connections.
