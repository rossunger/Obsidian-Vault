[[Kisala]] was viewed by some as the epitome of resilience. After serving on
a corrupt ethics committee for the king of Q for a few years, they had
spoken out, in an act of remorse, against some of the injustices that
they had allowed to transpire. Had they been more influential, Kisala
would probably have been assassinated and framed in some horrific way,
but as it stood, they were relegated to obscurity in some middle level
suburban hell, and subject to daily hate mail and dirty looks.

There were, of course, many who supported Kisala in their work, and
lauded them for their bravery, and reminded them that all the bigots can
go jump off a cliff, but that didn't stop each violent act from cutting
deep. Maybe it was an internalised sense of guilt that they felt for
being complicit in the system that left so many people behind. Maybe it
was a sense of shame that they had been so stupid as to allow the
blatant propaganda to seep into their brain. Whatever it was, Kisala was
falling apart, and didn\'t know who to talk to about it.
