What I've learned from phones about lovers
Is that you can't unbreak a broken screen
You could replace it with another
But the price is far too steep
You can't unsay a tone that's harsh
You can't unhurt a wounded heart
You can't unblurt out false retorts
You can't undoom what's torn apart

  

You only get one strike, don't blow it

Even a case will not protect them
From a drop at certain heights

Charge them frequently, and fully
(And update software when you can?)
