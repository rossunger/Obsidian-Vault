In the name of survival
How far will you go
How far will you go now?
How far how far?

Will you write your politicians?
Will you call up their homes
Will you show up for protests?
How far will you go

Will you give up your land rights
Will you give up your car
How far will you go? How far? How far?

And I don't wanna give up my integrity
Or compromise my ethics to survive
I wanna live my life in solidarity
With nature and prioritize the earth, and help her thrive

Quit growing corporations
Start growing vegetation
How many dollars so you need to feel good?
How will you know when you've finally got enough?

And I don't wanna give up my integrity
Or compromise my ethics to survive
I wanna live my life in solidarity
With nature and prioritize the earth, and help her thrive

In the name of survival
How far will you go
How far will you go now?
How far how far?

Will you write your politicians?
Will you call up their homes
Will you show up for protests?
How far will you go

Will you give up your land rights
Will you give up your car
How far will you go? How far? How far?
They're destroying our planet

We've gotta start thriving and not just surviving
