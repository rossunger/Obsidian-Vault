[[Greni]] had a hard time believing anything was real. Having managed the
imaginariums on the 29th floor for almost half their life, the line
between fantasy and praxis had been been blurred out of existence. If
these machines could simulate a reality so totally convincing, what's
to say that we weren't all just programs in a simulation. It was this
one delusion that allowed Greni to run this highly addictive drug den
with a clear conscience. Each day they would watch bored, wealthy folks
plug in an disappear for the day, and wonder if maybe that was the good
life. Of course, sometimes there would be folks paying in half used
sunpatches, and Greni just knew that they couldn't afford to keep this
up, and that was regrettable. At first, Greni had tried to help them by
offering advice, or connecting them with resources, but by now they
realised what a futile exercise that was.
