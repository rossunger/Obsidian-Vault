### Falling
Cry for me 
I will be falling through eternity
  
### Take A Piece Of My Heart
![[Take A Piece Of My Soul.mp3]]
Take a piece of soul
And carry it wherever you go
A beacon to guide you back
Whenever you find that you have lost the way
Or hope has gone away
  
And I will find you, I will find you
Whenever you’ve lost the way
And I will guide you, I will guide you
Back to where you belong
And then I'll show you, I will show you
The colors of all the world
And when you see them, and you will see them
You’ll start to lift and understand

### I Love You Still
![[I Love You Still.mp3]]
I cry for you
I cry for your heart
For the love there inside now it’s dead though it died without a cause
  
I feel for you
I feel for your heart
For the look in your eyes as we said our goodbyes forevermore

There was no time
It had to die
I loved you then I love you still


### Today I Save The Life Of An Innocent
![[Today I Save The Life Of An Innocent.mp3]]
Today I save the life of an innocent
Blackened with misery sin and woe
I shoulder their burden and trudge through the snow
Alone with the weight of an unwanted foe

They offer no thank you, no signs of remorse
No unbidden cognisense of my painful enforcement
Of my loneliness since then my soul is enslaved
By a love that respects it no more than it hates

So i cry not from pity nor pain nor regret
I cry for the soul who will drown and forget
How to love how to smile how to sour through the sky
While a burden not his will devour his life

### Have To
![[HaveTo(draft).mp3]]
You don't have to love me
But I don't have a choice
You don't get all happy every time you hear my voice
...

You don't have to want me
But I can't help but hope
...


You don't have to touch me
But I want you to
You don’t have to give me…

You don't have to think of me
But I think you do
  
You don't have to hold me
But you do it just the same

You don't have to be with me
But we're on the same plane

### K2  
![[K2.mp3]]
One of thought of you and suddenly you're coursing through my veins
You fill my mind you lift me up 
and steal my breath away
And all I want in all the world
Is just to hold you close
To be near you to feel you 
and know you inside out

### There May Be Days
![[There May Be Days.mp3]]
There may be days when you are down
When the world comes crashing down around you
One day you’ll see that you are blind
That all your troubles are behind you
The sky may be gray the sun may go away but you will still be there

And so you live a life of lies 
and then you wonder why your heart cries
the world revolves it’s keeping time, 
The time that passes by defining your spirit that cries my love for you that dies and slowly the poison spreads

But the pain is not so great that I must leave the world on your account  

a rose of love was sent to you
it never made it past the waiting queue
it chose to die rather than live
what’s the point when nobody would give it more than the slightest
thought the love that it sought was missing, what could it do?

the road it sought to find in you had not been born until too late
  
All spinning wheels must sometimes stop
that doesn’t mean that they can’t start again
the heart can only take so much after which it slowly starts to drown but such is life, a double edged knife that stabs you when you least expect it to
  

### Libera Mea Cuore
![[Libera Mea Cuore.mp3]]
Countless days float away
become years, they're full of tears
tears I cry for you cos you're so far I can barely remember your name

Libera mea cuore
Cuore trista, trista, tristisime
Oh lacrime verso
Compatisci me te imploro 
Libera mea cuore

### In The Night
![[In The Night.mp3]]
At the break of dawn
She will be alone again just as she always is
Just as she always does she’ll cry
  
If they knew how hard she tries to make them all feel loved 
But what did they ever do, what did they 
ever do for her?

In the night we they move like flies
In the night they cry all the time
In the night they fly

### Forever
![[Forever.mp3]]
The flowers blossom on a mid winters day
They know they cannot believe what they say
Running around in pairs of three
They know they will not be forgotten

No one noticed as he fell to the ground
His eyes unfocused and his thoughts all around
Her eyes her nose her lips her little hands
He spoke of love but got no answer

You’re breaking my heart as I die in the snow and wait for death to take me home
But home would be with you wherever you should be now and forever
I am all alone and so I say goodbye
  
She stood in silence as he laid down his heart
Her hands were dz shaking; she was playing her parts
He was so serious she had to laugh
She turned to look but he was gone

The truth it hit her she had noone to blame
Moments of happiness and moments of shame
In all the years that they had been but friends
It seems he’d loved her from the start

You’re breaking my heart as you run from my life and leave behind all that you love
What is this I feel whenever you are not around I never thought that I could love from as we say goodbye  

At last she found him letting tears to the snow
She kissed his forehead and never let go
She knew too well his time was running out
She held him close and made the best of their last days on earth

The snow keeps falling as they wait in the cue
Her mother’s calling but what can she do
She knows they will not be alone again
He will not make it through the night

You’re breaking my heart as you die in my arms while those around you fret and cry
They don’t know that you live forever 
Nothing ever lasts forever
All I know is this is where we say goodbye

### At The End
![[At The End.mp3]]
At the end of the day the flowers will be blooming
And those who believe in them will see that there is light
in the dark, at the end of the day

At the end of the day our love will rise again
Through the dust and the shadows
Our love will rise again
For it comes at the end of the day

You are my love tonight forever till we die
You the only one for 
There is no one dead or living who can see
That being happy alone can be lonely

At the end of the day you’ll hold my hand and smile
Nevermore to be lonely our love will guide us through
To the end at the end of the day
  
Through the darkness and the shadow
And the cold within you too
Where you are it will not matter 
I will find and shelter you
  
From the storm that is still coming and the storm within you too
When you’re frozen and your heart beats ever faster
I will show you life full of love and then 
You’ll keep moving on

You are my love tonight forever till I die
You the only one who will ever see the heart within me
And behold all the love there inside it is yours

You are my love tonight forever till I die
You the only one who will ever see the heart within me
And behold all the love there inside it is yours

### After The Storm
![[After The Storm.mp3]]
After the storm come peaceful tides
The place where dire hope resides
Where anger and anguish are mere memories

Faith, a serenade
what could be more truly made than
the way I feel for you

I know my heart is true

### Forgive Me
![[ForgiveMeSep4.mp3]]
How about we begin again
Light the candle let the violets in
Help them to grow into mighty things
Stop the candle from extinguishing

How about we forget this place
Run away and live out old cliches
Take to the mountains and the parking lots
Fin'lly learn to cherish what we've got
  
How about no more arguments
Unplug the power from you electric fence
Let me run wild in your garden of lies
And let me burn the flowers I despise

How about I burn the garden down
No more lies and you can burn my crown
What if you found that there was nothing left
Would you forgive me my dearly bereft

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;
Please forgive me; Please forgive me;
Please forgive me my love

How about we take a break from "no"
Don't ignore me when I beg "don't go"
Have you forgotten what I did for you
Well, can't say I'm surprised, fuck you too

How about we fin'lly call it quits
Load the baggage up and end this shit
Wait for the buses which will take us home
And dispose of all this love we've grown

How about you forget my name
Close your mind and filter out the pain
Turn to those friends who have forgotten you
Build those broken bridges up anew

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;
Please forgive me; Please forgive me;
Please forgive me my love
And then help me to move on
  

### Our Dancing Days Are Through
![[Our Dancing Days Are Through.mp3]]
Our time is up
Our dancing days are over
Now we only talk of small things
And wonder what we did before

We pulled the plug
Set free all our emotions
But turns out that you're still hurting
And there's nothing I can do

### We’re Through
![[We're Through.mp3]]
Was it something I said
Or something I did
We were so good just before
And now we're shit

Tell me what to do to make it good
Tell me how on earth you think I should
Move on and just forget someone like you
Someone like you

Can't you see you make me feel alive
I've been waiting for you all my life
And now, you say we're through
  
You were gone for a day
I was there for years
You didn't even have time to say goodbye
Or shed some tears

Maybe I could be somebody else
Maybe you could change the way you felt so sure
That there was no more time for me
Someone like me
Can't you see you make me feel alive
I've been waiting for you all my life
And now, you say we're through

I believe that everyone can learn to fly together
So why you tellin' me that we can't be no more

Tell me what to do to make it good
Tell me how on earth you think I should
Move on and just forget someone like you
Someone like you

Maybe I could be somebody else
Maybe you could change the way you felt so sure
That there was no more time for me 
Someone like me

Can't you see you make me feel alive
I've been waiting for you all your life
And now, you say we're through

### The World
![[The World.mp3]]
When I hold you in my arms, I’m pretty sure the world revolves ‘round us
Even in the darkness of the night, I can still believe in a world of light
Cry for all the sadness in your soul, even though we live in a different world
Even though he doesn’t understand, she will be the one to hold your hand in the end

### Don’t Know
![[Don't Know.mp3]]
You broke my heart,
flew away when things got hard
I didn’t mind, I knew that it would heal in time
All the bitter memories
All the wasted hope
How did we ever forget the meaning of love
And how do we carry on without it I just don’t 
Know, anymore, why we live or love at all
You waste my time with broken words and broken lies
I waste your life say I love, but really die, 
All the bitter memories
All the wasted hope
How did we ever forget the meaning of love
And how do we carry on without it I just don’t know
what to do, I cannot live without your soul next to mine
I find I cannot reconcile
All the bitter memories
All the wasted hope
How did we ever forget the meaning of love
And how do we carry on without it I just don’t 

### Wonderful
![[S1 Wonderful.mp3]]
I had no doubt but turns out your wonderful
You’re filling my mind and I suddenly find that I am missing you
And it’s not ok, not in any way
I just wanna be your friend but I don’t how

You suddenly kiss me and suddenly yeah!
I’m blinded bliss and I falling through air
You suddenly kiss me and blinded by bliss
I subtly miss all the sign of abyss
How you cry how you fall how you oh oh oh

I just wanna say I’m sorry
I just wanna relive moments of our glory
Moment of our former glory

### Don’t Be Scared Boy  
![[Dont Be Scared Boy.mp3]]
In an empty lot we built a shelter even though we had a home
Before sunrise is how it felt
We walked for hours talked our fill and then we stopped
Before midnight we’re on a hill
Pulled a 20 dollar wedding dress up to our chin
I made a cavern and you fell in

Don’t Be Scared Boy this is who you are
We took turns blurring lines between what makes us boy and girl
Danced through fields of gold and time stood still
1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 4 and
  

### Can’t Get You Out Of My Mind
I can’t get you out of my mind
And maybe I don’t want to
Maybe I don’t know how or why
But you …

And don’t you know you‘ve been

### Bathtub Space Machine
![[BathTubSpaceMachine.mp3]]
We’ll row our way through town in our bathtub space machine
You’ll rub me down, I’ll rub you off our play be obscene
my scent will scream through foreign words, you’ll giggle as we drown
We’ve lost the plot, our life’s surreal, we’ll paint the greens as brown

The bug keeps spitting popcorn on your face
and I keep melting in your sweet embrace
smell my armpits, eat my hair, take me with you everywhere
let this be a tale of duck and bear   
  
### As I Live And Breathe
![[As I Live And Breathe.mp3]]
When I close my eyes 
You float across my mind 
And I just want to fly to you and 
Wander by your side

You live and breathe inside of me, 
I drown as I run out of you
I see your face on every tree, 
I lose I mind when I don’t see you

### Winter Scars
![[WinterScars.mp3]]
You come home and fall to sleep
You wake up and rush to leave
It's almost like you wish I wasn't here

You'll drink caffeine to see your friends
But you're too tired to make amends with me
It's like you honestly don't care

So why am I still here? 
What did I see in you that made me volunteer my heart, my time, 
and dedicate my life to you 
if even for a year or two



Why did you drag me all this way across the world
When you were still in love with another girl
Don't tell me that you love us both when I can see 
You're sick of me and loathe that I am in your bed not she
When she's not even sure she wants you
She taunts you
She haunts you

When they're in the room you make me small
When they leave I fade against the wall
You make me feel invisible



We've both made compromises, both had it tough
You pour yourself another even though you've had enough
Your words are gonna beat me to a pulp

  

You've lit your fuse, you've blocked your ears
You're gonna blow, I'll end in tears

  

You smash my heart with your crowbar words
I shiver helplessly under the kitchen herbs
It doesn't help to know we'll be alright

  

So why am I still here? 
What did I see in you that made me volunteer my heart, my time, 
and dedicate my life to you 
if even for a year or two

  
Why did you drag me all this way across the world
When you were still in love with another girl
Don't tell me that you love us both when I can see 
You're sick of me and loathe that I am in your bed not she
When she's not even sure she wants you
She taunts you
She haunts you
  
You've lost your kindness, you've lost your words
Your sense of reason has grown absurd
You don't come home, you didn't call
I drank your whiskey trying to fill the hole

I'm sorry if I trashed your room, but look at what you've done to me
What are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?


Your biting words sink teeth in skin
And puncture vitals from within
I should shred my shrivelled spinal cord asunder

  

ignored  /  bored

torn / forlorn

  

### Bird And Bear
![[BirdAndBear.mp3]]
Bird takes a walk down sydney road
bear has a hunger for flying
bird says to bear man the badgers fried and the kettle’s cooked and crying aw yeah

Bird brings a blanket of feathery down
Bear brings a fur to the table
Bird says to bear if I spill some milk should I clean it if I am able 

Two unlikely creatures walking walking on the town
Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns
  
Bird has a box of empty matches
Bear has a silver spoon
Neither cares what the public thinks
they’re gonna make their dreams come true
  
Bird and bear take a trip with hare
Gonna hop like party rabbits
Bear drops his dacks and bird gives a quick
Hey, we all got unlikely habits

Two unlikely creatures walking walking on the town
Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns

Bear’s got a plan for sunday morning, 
Bird’s gotta fly the coop
Bear forgets, but there’s no regrets cos the cat is in the soup

Two unlikely creatures walking, walking on the town
Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns


### Bambi And Rabbit 
![[BambiAndRabbit.mp3]]
Bambi and rabbit by the fire
Holding hands down in the dark
Out of nowhere comes a __

Bambi and Rabbit by the fire
Holding hands bambi says goodbye
The kisses in her eyes are glowing
and the badger knows its time

  

### Give Me A Reason
![[Give Me A Reason.mp3]]
That's the second tub of ice-cream gone
And the dirty clothes are piling up
No guests have sat on beer stained couch for days or weeks or maybe months? who knows.

I've changed the channel maybe 50 times
the same three shows diffuse my brain
And sleep would seem a heaven sent
if only Sunday wasn't such a waste

Give me a reason to wake up another day
or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

A Face of blonde and eyes of green, Synaptic floods un-stitch my seams
An impulse drives me up about, I lace my boots and stutter out
roll down the street of mem'ry lane, and find a house with iv'ry cane
I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I'm here. I don't why I'm here, and faith give in to fear

Give me a reason to wake up another day
or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

I ring the bell, you ope' the door, a feral pussy licks the floor
I don't know why I came to you, we made some tea, you drank some stew
A lonely night spoke words so few, you smoked through pleasantries and then she
came along and said goodnight, I left the building with no light

Give me a reason to wake up another day
or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey
Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey


### Hashera
![[HasheraJun17.mp3]]
Hashera don’t make me choose
I don’t wanna lose either of you
Woah hashera why can’t you just agree to this polyamoury and let me love you. 

I introduced you to my friend you hit it off and then you spent
the weekend in each other’s glove
and now you think that you’re in love
  
Hashera don’t make me choose
I don’t wanna lose either of you
Woah hashera why can’t you just agree to this polyamoury and let me love you. 

  

### Turn Back The Time
![[TurnBackTheTime.mp3]]
Give me the words to turn back the time
To stop you from lying awake every night
To stop you from crying through your bailey’s and milk
thinking nothing can sew up the tears in your silk

The silk of your heartstring which play like a harp
I’m sorry I plucked them with fingers so sharp
The heart is a system made of sinews and blood
and I’m sorry dropped yours in a river of mud
But usually people have nylon to spare
And i’m sorry you’re drowning in floods of despair
And I don't know how I can help you now

### Are You What You Say You Are (KP)
![[Are You What You Say You Are KP1-2.mp3]]
You make me smile when you look at me
and I don’t know why but it’s unsettling
to know that you love but that you don’t want me

You may be nice, and I don’t know why it doesn’t suffice
for my tender sensibilities 
you know I want you here with me

Are you what you say you are?
Or are you just fucking with my mind
And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more

Are you what you say you are?
Or are you just fucking with my soul
and do I trust your well formed lies, or should I bring a change of heart

Are you what you say you are?
or have you been playing from the start
and am I gonna be alright or should I bring a change of heart
tell me what’s the price of pain, or should I charge you by the hour?
and I don’t really play these games, so whats the point of all this power

Are you what you say you are?
Or are you just fucking with my head
and do I trust your well formed lies, or should I bring a change of heart
Are you what you say you are?
or were you playing from the start
and am I gonna be alright or should I bring a change of heart
tell me what’s the price of pain, or should I charge you by the hour?
And I don’t really play these games, so whats the point of all this power
Are you what you say you are?
Or are you just fucking with my soul
And do I really want your bones or will they leave me feeling cold
And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more
a minute more

Are you what you say you are?
Or are you just fucking with my soul
And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more
a minute more

### Preserve The Royal Bloodline
![[PreserveTheRoyalBloodline.mp3]]
Massage my back with needle gloves
We'll all sit in a circle
And like the candle brightly glows
We'll lose our shirts to soft pillows
These lively friends will soon be friendly lovers

Ill wrap my legs around your legs
We'll have a slumber party
And when I gently kiss your neck
Just treat it like a friendly peck
And if you want my finger ask me nicely

I want your blood inside my blood
Preserve the Royal bloodline
Party it down on astro turf
  
### Your Love
![[Your Love.mp3]]
(lyrics by Rose Muller)
  
You love has got me trapped inside an open cage
If you keep feeding me, acting like you're needing me
I won't ever leave

But fear is a goddess who won't keep me for long
Cause really I'm the captor and you are just an actor, 
paid to scream on cue, 
but now I've risen above you

Never looking back, no
your reality is whack, no
I'm sick of your love boy

Wondering through your maze, boy
Your presence is a haze boy
I'm so confused by you, no

Never looking down, no
Wond'ring if you've found, no 
A room in your heart for me

You love has got me trapped inside an open cage
And I can't even reach you, cos you're a little leach, you don't really care about me
Cause really I'm the lover, and you're just a fighter paid to point and shoot
but now I've risen above you

Never looking back, no
your reality is whack, yo
I'm sick of your love boy

Wondering through your maze, boy
Your presence is a haze boy
I'm so confused by you, no

Never looking down, no
Wond'ring if you've found, no 
A little room in your heart for me

### Kindred Spirits
![[KindredSpirits1.mp3]]
You don’t have to fill the silence
I don’t have to hold your hand
phantom limbs betray our senses
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits

lose our heads and loose our shoulders
all our laughters eggs and jam
breakfast is a wholesome option 
help me find out who I am

we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred souls

You don’t have to think like I do, you don’t have to like gazelles
just dance your heart like no one’s watching
and tell me you can be yourself

lose our heads and loose our shoulders
all our laughters eggs and jam
breakfast is a wholesome option 
help me find out who I am

we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred souls

grab a tree branch strum a chord
raise the past and press record
you part your lips and through the gloom 
angelic voices fill the room

You don’t have to fill the silence
I don’t have to hold your hand
just dance your heart like no one’s watching
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits

lose our heads and loose our shoulders
all our laughters eggs and jam
breakfast is a wholesome option 
help me find out who I am
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred spirits
we are kind and kindred souls


### Fort Mac
![[FortMac.mp3]]
I crossed over seas to be with her,
Now I wither away in a
Small country town
Fueled by tar oil sands 
Fueled by tar oil sands 
Fueled by tar oil sands 

I go to church in a gym, play piano and sing
Put up cameras for cash, they don't pay me enough for the work I do
Everyone here drives a truck and the sit in their Sports bars, snorting their Drugs
just a year down the line, just a year down the line
they'll be all burning down
they'll be burning down
they'll be burning down

I came to be wife, now I feel like a trophy
Playing piano in my birthday tux
Smoking tobacco to release the frustration
She don't want me here, nobody wants me here

Negative 30, feels like 40 below
Never been in a blizzard, now my mouth's full of snow
Thought I'd walk to a forests or a lake
lay my head on a log, close my eyes, clear my mind
my brain is fogging up

tried nonmonogomy, 
this polyamory 
quickly enamoured me, 
lost in the in between
kissed a cute girl I knew, 
her husband got mad at me, 
can't go to town no more, 
stuck on a condo floor

Im sorry I wasnt good enough
Im sorry that I couldn't pick you up
Im sorry that I had to leave so soon
  
### E1
![[E1.mp3]]
I see your picture on the wall
the pencil lines are fading
and the colored shading bleeds
has it really been so long?

through diary pages I recall
all the scribbled changes
as you rearranged us so
tell me where do I belong?

did you really think you'd find the time
to ....

### Magnetic
![[Magnetic.mp3]]
You don’t have to worry
I’ll be there soon
When the lights go and the fire has all but subside
I will find you heart a new

  

### Sensitive Robot
![[Sensitive Robot Demo.mp3]]
KATIE
I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He drives me crazy, and he’s gotta go
I’m in love with a sensitive robot
….
…..
…..
……
……
…..
A shoestring budget
and likes to calculate precisely what it costs
To be in love with me
Someone insane as me
To be in love with a sensitive me

I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got
I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He’s such a confident fella; sometimes I forget
He still has feelings
Is always dealing
With existential crises 
And conflicting lies, 
He loves contriving
Is always striving
To find a better way to minimize the loss
Of being loved by me
Someone insane as me
I can't believe that he's living with me

ROSS
I’m in love with a sensitive psycho
She drives me crazy and she’s gotta go
I’m in-

KATIE
-Then he tries to be romantic, but the words all come out wrong
He talks about “my function” but he means to say that we belong

Sometimes he’s lazy
And I go a crazy 
And stir up wild disputes
His brain does not compute
He has no filter
Gets out of kilter
When I’m sarcastic or passively aggressive
But still we make it through

ROSS
I don’t know how we do
  
DUET
I’m just in love with a sensitive you

DUET
I tell him/her all these stories full of petty pointless facts
I know they really bore him/her but still s/he will react
To make me feel appreciated
Psychotic/Robotic love is underrated

My sensitive robot like to hide behind a facade of facts 

….relax / contracts

BRIDGE
But when s/he curls up in my arms
And fires up his/her snuggling charms
You know s/he melts my little heart

ENDING
You can’t help it if you’re smart
It doesn’t change what’s in your heart

You might not think the way I do
But god knows robots feel things too

He stacks the dishes
Makes eyelash wishes

I tell him stories
with ducks and _  (s,s,s, + trees, cheese, breeze, )

I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got
I’m in love with a sensitive robot
At least he doesn’t pretend to be what he’s not
He likes to throw snot,
And doesn’t know what
To do when I am mad
But he’s not all bad
He stacks the dishes
Makes eyelash wishes
and likes to calculate precisely what it costs
To be in love with me
Someone insane as me
To be in love with a sensitive me

I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got
I’m in love with a sensitive robot
He’s such a confident fella; sometimes I forget
He still has feelings
Is always dealing
With existential crises 
And conflicting lies, 
He loves contriving
Is always striving
To find a better way to minimize the loss
Of being loved by me
Someone insane as me
I can't believe that he's living with me

you may always win at chess
but you don’t need to be the best
you just can’t help it if you’re smart
doesn’t change what’s in your heart 

  
### I Was Alright (E6)
![[E6 18-07-2012 12_32 AM.m4a]]
I was alright till you came into my life
Taught me how to feel by breaking my little heart
You were my friend, that’s how these things always start
And looking back I’m wondering how do you tell the two apart

### Trust Too Much
When you feel too much and it blows up in your face
When you know how to love but you don’t see a trace
Of why you came here in the first place

When you feel too much and it blows up in your face
When she knows how to love but you don’t see a trace
Of love in her eyes

So why am I still here?
why am I still here?
why am I still here?
why am I still here?

### What Love Is
How do you know when it’s time to give up when you’ve done all you can?

We know We know We know what love is
That’s not the point, the point _

How do you know when enough is enough when you’ve heard/hurt all you can
  

### The Ones You Love
When you just can’t trust the ones who love you
Then what’s the point of all this love?
  
### Ride Out The Waves
Wake up and live, it’s better then dying
Make up a smile or a sparkle; you’re not even trying
Show me the dream girl I met on the street
Full of life, love, and laughter in the face of defeat

Don’t let the water, drown out your flame
Your days will get better, let go of the shame
Let me help guide you; just hold on my hand
Together we’ll ride out these waves to the land



She’s a handful of sand that slowly slips through my fingers  

So I will not abide her whimsy, I am not her fool
I’m not smashing empty vases
No more threats with empty razors
Trying desperately to reach her
Trying desperately to breach her 
Self-destructive defenses
Her Iron-clad fences

The pillars of sand
That rise up and stand 
protecting your heart
turned to glass and in part
keep the waves from destroying you 
but keep your soul from enjoying too

Sometimes it takes for someone to believe in you

### Magic Moments
Your smile makes the problems seem so much smaller 
your eyes bring me back to life, back to reality 
you remind me to pause
to rethink
to breath 
and to love you again

a broken bike wheel
a ten minute giggle at the crosswalk
You'll cross on the next one 
You'll cross on the next one
You'll cross on the next one
I hope you never leave

mushy soup with pickles
and mayo on everything

forcing me to giggle when I’m mad
keeping me awake 

holding my hand in the streets when I shouldn’t be scared
kissing my thighs when I feel like a whale

watching strangers walk by, singing songs about ducks, wearing my dresses   

falling off bikes, mosquito filled hikes 

bus ride cuddles and naughty blankets   

bathroom rendezvous, filming your poo
What, you pick locks now? 
You’re wearing my socks now?
You’re trading in stocks now?

Leeches and beaches
6am wake ups, emergency shake ups
cake on your make up 
watching me sleep
holding your finger while you sleep

blood in the sheets, our fort is complete, need more tent poles to hold up the blanket

hide in the sheet when the world has depleted you

rinse out the dyes from the colorful eyes you throw me

kicked out of carts in the grocery store  ([wal]marts)
need to wear shoes, on almost every floor 

laugh at the sign no shoes no shirt no service
‘not him again’

the world makes sense with you by my side
no fears, or anxiety,  and no need to hide 
brainy talks and rainy walks

rollerblades wipe outs, close to getting hit

videos of me sweating at the gym
screeches of leeches when we go for a swim 
  

### Love Fades Away
![[Love Fades Away.mp3]]
Love Fades Away

  
### Let Me Go
You think you know someone well don’t
Chuck that wretched thought, or if you won’t
Then let me save you a whole __ of pain 
This people aren’t what they say

You thought that you knew me but you really didn’t know
What she’d do to you
Now you’re really low

Let me go, Let me go back where I’m from


### Came For A Summer
![[Came for a summer stayed for a lifetime.mp3]]
You came for a summer, you stayed for a lifetime
And now that you’re here everything’s changed
And I don’t know who I am
And I don’t know where to go
Without you
So come on back and let us see

You are my _

You are my _  
  



### You Dont Understand
![[You Dont Understand.mp3]]
I open my eyes and what do i see
but your little eyes and they're looking at me
I don't know the truth but I do know your heart
oh tell me why you and me are a part of love

you open your eyes and what do you see
but my little hands and they're hanging off me
you don't know the truth, but you do know my heart 
so what makes you think that we are apart of love
you don't understand, why,

### MARE’S POEM
First we sweat
Siyahamba, hamba
Then find me after your road trip 
at the stroke of midnight 
And we’ll play 
Space ship resonance
And thank god for our daily braid
With peanut butter 
And honey 
Spread slow 
It’s more like cake, really

you look like a movie star from this angle 
Cos you can rock anything 
Fearlessly 
I blush
I gush 
All three little MEs
slowly accepting that Its all sacred pink
Even the hospital bed
Especially that one
We want that one
twinkley lights
Stars and moons
Iridescence
Like the last’s piece of grape fruit
That you saved just for me

please Don’t take the edge off
disgusting 
we don’t want that
Ride it Like a centaur!
Dump the holiday nog!
But tread carefully 
Because two innocent lives can be saved
Practice silence 
Then spill your guts out
in cheeky Russian,
Or whatever. 
No wrong answers 

I do need more 
Than this modern world 
Tension, release, repeat.
I live for this shit 
But it’s all new to me
And I’m scared 
No running away. No putting up walls. No kicking anyone out.
Even when things change dramatically
Even if it’s a friggin Tsunami
Im off the deep end 

check in with me, often
Play me, unbridled 
Help me invite you in, gently 
Or have your higher self do it

Hold me.  

Two of us on the run 
we’ve been around the block before
But this time it’s different
The path is too narrow to run
So Just sit with me
Om with me
Mirthfully
Blue eyes. You’re the secret I keep.
We are laughing fiends
Dancing evergreens 
Scored with mhmmms and dreamy vibes 
Scorpio rise
So touch my face
You dirty stinko 
Inhale me
I want you to 
But 
What’s OK & not OK?
Tension, release repeat 

In the meantime
Dream a little dream of me 
As soon as you wake up 
sniff my pillow
Send a red heart 
And I’ll smile. 
And sing you ABCD
Because that’s how magic works
Immaculately conceived 
Baby 
cow 
Baby
Millenial
Baby 
teeth
Coconut clean 
Great hair 
So Please- Be mine?
You are my sunshine 
Jai jai guru dun 

  
### BABY COW
She wakes in a daze as the baby cow prays. Non-attachment and desire holding hands, sparking fire. Walk outside bring a blanket, hug a tree, should I thank it? Say farewell to the guests, birthday dinner of strangers,sit in snow, melt my heart, play pretend nothing changes.
Take a walk, walking slowly, colors pop, how you know me

I want you I want you I want you

No ID, we don't need it, warm our hands as you lead me in a role play we're strangers, feel the subwoofer, danger, pick me up, back to my place? Just jossing. But for real, now you're coming? Drinking tea, setting timers, can't express, what's that hiding? Gotta go? Now we're falling, it's a trap? Nah, its our calling 

Fuckin love ya. Fuck, I love ya. I love you. Kidding. Not kidding.   
  

### COCONUT KISSES
Coconut kisses pull the gunk from our souls,
We birth a new era, floating far from our fears
Breaking ground, breaking, grounding, grinding,
Finding new ways of staying, splaying bare naked souls
Bodies writhing, we’re thriving on smiles and ecstatics
Dancing, thrashing, rehashing all the years that have happened since I saw you this morning
Yeah, we’re working, hardly working, being worked on,
Observing, deserving, we deserve to be happy, take the time to be present,
To be pleasant, you’re a gift, I give you, I’ll give to you, anything, everything. 

  
### BROKEN
Get me out of this awful place  
Help me out here I’m broken  
Tell me how to get of here  
Help me out here I’m broken  
  
And I heave and I cry and I hope I die
And I’m steel till I break and I don’t know why 

And I’m tired of feeling broken
And I’m tired of not knowing 
And I’m tired of what’s left unspoken
When I’m feeling alone


### We Found God
![[WeFoundGod.mp3]]
We found god
In all the darkest places
When we thought we couldn’t take no more
We found good

And I don’t wanna die, I don’t wanna die alone
I’m not ready to go

Just when we thought it was over now
Just when we thought we could take no more
Just when I thought I could count the stars
Turns out I was wrong


### The Music Starts Again
![[TheMusicStartsAgain.mp3]]
Just when you thought it was over
When you couldn’t take no more
Just when you thought it was over
The music starts again

And when you fall
The Sun will rise
And when you call me
I can never see the sky again

### Surrender Mantra
![[SurrenderMantra.mp3]]
I accept my path 
And embrace the greater vision
I believe in what's to come
I will not resist it
  
I'll step into my role
And trust the universe to guide me
Moving bravely through my fears
Everything I need's inside me

I accept my pain
And hold space for darker feelings
I will not avoid what's hard
The only way through pain is healing

I accept what is
And trust that there's a reason for it
Every hardship is a gift
And I will not deplore it 


### Come On Home
![[ComeOnHomeNow.mp3]]
And I can’t wait to come on home 
I can’t wait to let you know
I don’t know what we’ve been waiting for
And I can’t believe we could ever come so far

  
### Show Me The Way Back Home
![[Show Me The Way Back Home excerpt .mp3]]
I’ve been sad for so long I forgot
What it’s like to be happy I thought I knew
How to find my way back home through the maze of life
Now I’m lost I can see I’m blind

Show me the way back home and I’ll come
Take my hand and we’ll run run run
Show me the way to be happy again
And watch over me, don’t let me fall asleep again

### Broken
![[Broken.mp3]]
Get me out of this awful place, help me out here I'm broken
Tell me how to get out of here, help me out here I'm broken
And I see and I sigh and I know what's right
and I feel and I sigh and I always try

... hypnotised by the ...

Get me out of this awful place, help me out here I'm broken
Tell me how to get out of here, help me out here I'm broken
And I see and I sigh and I know what's right
and I feel and I sigh and I always try

and I'm tired of __
and I'm tired of 
and I'm tired of not knowing


### Daydream
Why can’t we all just daydream

  
### Running in the Woods and never coming back
![[Running in the woods and never coming back.m4a]]
Running in the Woods and never coming back

  
### Oh Moon
![[OhMoon.mp3]]
Oh moon, that glows up in the sky
Oh stars, shining oh so bright I see you
Thank you for your light 
For shining oh so bright
And guiding us this night
I thank you

### I Can’t Believe 
![[]]
I can’t believe we could live in a place so sweet
I never thought we could fin’lly see the trees could …

### If I thought I couldn’t
If I thought I couldn’t kiss you
If I thought I’d have to miss you
For the rest of my existence
I would lose my fucking mind

  
  
### Let Go 
(voice memo)
We’ve finally let go
We’re finally set free
And we don’t know what’s coming up for us  

### Pray
You just pray, pray
Pray to all your gods and all the spirits watching over you

When the fates have spoken
When you’re cold and feeling broken
When you know you just can’t anymore
See the light at the end of the tunnel you just fall and pray
  
### Witches Song 

(voice memo)  
I never thought that it could end this way
I never thought that we could be this great
And now i know that we are here to stay
Oh god I love our witchy way
Oh god I love our witchy way
Oh god I love our witchy way

### Home, Where I Belong
![[Home, Where I Belong.mp3]]
and I who goes with the flow
and tries to live in the know
and I will trust in the water to carry me 
home where I belong



Found

  
  
  

### Don’t Want To Leave Her Behind
And I don’t want to leave her behind
And I don’t want her feeling unkind

  
  

### Banjo 
(Decemberists style)
when I saw her in the sky she was wearing no disguises
but when she landed on her feet all her colors were slightly pleated

how was I know that she was really hiding her scars(?)

  
  


### Sunshine
![[Sunshine.mp3]]
I don't know how I could ever see ... .
waking up with sunshine on your face, I see you I smile
Holding your hands in my hand I feel the sunshine in my life
In your eyes reflected all the clouds and all the stars up in the sky
and I ........

Love is all around us we just have to see
And not mistake the forest for the tree
    

### Words are spells
![[Projects/LoveStories/Vol4/Words are spells.mp3]]
Words are spells and you will cast them
So watch what you say, and think twice when cursing
  
### Smiling back at me
There's magic in your eyes
And when I look you in the face I see you smiling back at me
And you don't even know my name
And I can't see a way through this
And I don't know where you could possibly find such joy in life



Youre special
I know you're special
I know that you've got greatness coming up for you
I know you're fueled by doing something special with you life

  
And I admire you for all you do

And I can see that there is nothing stopping you

  
  
### Broken Bones
Loving partners feels like breaking all my bones, 
running into walls of brick again and again, 
they never seemed to set quite right, 
tried my best to be a doctor, but the text books don't suffice, 
trying something new each time, 
maybe broken bones feel better than mishappen ones, 
more reflective of how you feel inside, 
and every time you wonder, maybe this time will be the last?

  
### Breathe deep
![[Breathe deep2.m4a]]
Breathe deep and feel the air 
let the winds in your hair remind to listen

Hold still, your body is speaking
It's desperately seeking to tell you
What you need to know
So please listen like your life depends on it
Because it does, yes it does

Breathe deep, dont judge your mind
Dont be defined, by what you've been thinking

Hold still, your body is speaking
It's desperately seeking to tell you
What you need to know
So please listen like your life depends on it
Because it does, yes it does

  
### I Won't Give Up On You
![[]]
There's nothing I can say
To make anything ok
But I'll try
because what else can I do

I could not take care of you
You really needed me to
And god I tried
But I let you down

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I
And I will try to glue us back until the day I die
Though everything between us, needs time and care to heal,
I won't give up on you or how I feel

We sewed each others dreams
We were bursting at the seams
And god we tried
But we could not make it work

And I just disappeared
And nothing left was clear
And how you tried
But I just need more time

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I
And I will try to glue us back until the day I die
Though everything between us, needs time and care to heal,
I won't give up on you or how I feel

Broken, crushed by the weight of what's left unsaid
Taking a life, and watching your dreams crumble in your head
And I can only guess how hard it feels to feel alone
And nothing I can do can make it right

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I
And I cant glue us back, but God you know i have to try
And only time will tell if it can ever truly heal,
But I will not give up on you

### On My Mind
![[OnMyMind.mp3]]
and you’re on my mind 
nearly all the time
and I don't know what the hell to do
every scent and sound and the sight of you reminds me of the way you've been on my mind
you've been on my mind

then you hold my hand
and I understand
what the universe has got in store
for the likes of us, who have come before
I've known you many times as you've been
on my mind
you've been on my mind
  
### If you only knew me
![[If You Only Knew Me.mp3]]
I've fallen down and I can't get back up again
I've tried a hundred times there's nothing left within me now
And if you only knew me back when I had a thousand stories in me

Now I spend my days in catatonic states of mind
Remembering when all the lucky stars aligned for me
Back when I was weird and wonderful
Full of life and willing to be wrong

How the times have changed now
How the colors fade out
How the world keeps turning even though it makes no sense

I was an artist with a million ideas
I conjured musics that our spirits longed to hear
I gave my life to telling stories that I had to share
I don't know who i am without them
How am I supposed to even care

I watch myself unravel everything that's wrong
There's extra pieces and I'm sure they don't belong here now
But who am I to cut them from my deck
Maybe they're just helping me reflect

How the times have changed now
How the colors fade out
How the world keeps turning even though it makes no sense

Im hope that someday I will get back up again
Shake off this winterlog and pick back up my pen and write all the thousand stories that I cried 
In the time I'd fallen down in spite of

How the times had changed now
How the colors fade out
How the world kept turning even though it made no sense
  


### Is it me that you've been looking for
![[Is it me that you've been looking for.m4a]]
Is it me that you've been looking for?
I hear that life’s been knocking on your door
It's time
It’s time to let em in  

### Sing up our prayers
![[Sing up our prayers 5.m4a]]
And we sing up our prayers
And we let down our tears
For the things we cannot fathom
That have touched upon our lives

And we say our goodbyes
As they lay in the ground
And we swear to remember 
All the ways they've touched lives
  
And the love never ends
Even though sometime we may pretend
As our worlds fall apart 
While we mend our broken hearts
  
And we say our goodbyes 
As they head for the skies
And our worlds are changed forever
Though we don't yet know just how

So we sing up our prayers
And we let down our tears
For the things we can't fathom
That have touched upon our lives

And we know we'll never see them 
But their memory lives on

  
  

### Set me free
![[Set me free 3.m4a]]
Show me the way, Teach me to pray
Help me to say, What’s been weighing me down

Open my mind, Help me be kind to me
I’ve been so resigned , To the way things were
it’s become a blur, It’s cold and dark here so

Set me free, From all the things 
That other people, Put, on me

Help me forgive myself, for all that I’ve lived where I 
Didn't say no when it, Hurt so bad

All of the pain that I,  Suffered in vain when I
Could have just left, let it teach me now
Show me why and how, And let it leave me

Set me free, From all the things 
That other people, Put, on me

Let me go, and help me grow
It’s time I learned, how to be, alone

INTERLUDE

take me away, don’t let me stay here
I wasn’t made to be broken and sad

Help me revive my heart, I’m still alive, my god,
It’s time to thrive, and to shine my light
on the darkest night, And fill that cup so

Set me free, From all the things 
That other people, Put, on me

Let me go, and help me grow
It’s time I learned, how to be, alone

  
### Where Did I Go Wrong?
![[Where did I go wrong.m4a]]
Where did I go wrong 
When did I become a villain 
In the stories of their lives
When did all of our love die?

  
### Emerging from the Dark
![[Emerging from darkness.m4a]]
I’m lost in the darkness
The lights all go out
And the lines all surround
And I see in the darkness

And I can’t believe _ _ _
And I can’t believe _ _ _ 

I’m lost in the darkness
Couldn’t find my way upstairs
Then the lights all surround me 
Even though no-one cares

And I can’t believe what I’m seeing
And I can’t believe I'm alive again

I’m lost in the darkness
All the trouble come undone
And the night plays on madness
And light feels like fire

And I can’t believe what I’m seeing
And I can’t believe _ _ _
  
The doorways are open
Nevermind the way back home
Let the spirits surround us
And forget all you've known

### Everything's Great
![[EverythingIsGreat.mp3]]
This is a song about how everything is great and even though we didn't make it, we'll just chalk it up to fate
I loved you and you loved me
But we couldn't find a way for us to be 
Happy 
But at least we tried
Kinda sorta, maybe we just let it die?
But I don't mind
I'll be fine 
And I won't even erase you from my mind
I'll be kind as I can
When I can

This is a song about how everything is fine, and even though it broke my heart I guess I'm glad we cut the line
I was hurting a lot 
And you're saying you were giving all you got
So why would we
carry on
Like some teenage lovers stuck inside a plot
Where you know 
how it ends,
But you still watch them get all tangled up in knots
So I guess I'm glad 
that we're not
Anymore

This is a song about how everything is wrong
And even though we had the feelings I just never could belong
In your world when I've got mine
There just never seems to be sufficient time
We've all got roles in each other's lives
And you trigger me to hell and back, that's fine
That's just your soul being kind
Helping me to heal the wounds I'd left behind
And I dont mind
I dont mind
I just wish it didn't leave me feeling blind
And it won't 
When I go into the light

Winter Cradle

I wake up each morning and I hope it's today
When I finally wake up feeling somewhat okay

And I've been in a daze for as long as I remember
And I feel like a crazy person falling to their Doom

Help me god 
To remember love
And to pray in ways
That I keep forgetting now
Show me please
All those fantasies
