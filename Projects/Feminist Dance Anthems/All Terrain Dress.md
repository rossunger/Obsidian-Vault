I want a dress with deep pockets. So I can carry all my stuff
I'm sick of handbags, and tiny clutches, and the misogyny from whence
they come
I want zippers and soft lining, so I can warm my hands when it's cold
I want a hood that folds open, So I can hide my face from the rain, and
seem tough
To strangers, who might be watching, as I'm walking home down the street
And it's stretchy, for all sizes, so I don't have to watch what I eat

My all terrain dress, My all terrain dress
My all terrain dress

I want a dress for 3 seasons, so I can wear it all year round
It transforms into a poncho, but it's strapless and I can still wear it
out
I want a dress that lasts forever, that's durable, and resistant to dirt
and
Stains, it's all natural, and it's not gonna rip if I fall or climb a
Tree, it's got hooks for carabiners, and all sort of tomfoolery
