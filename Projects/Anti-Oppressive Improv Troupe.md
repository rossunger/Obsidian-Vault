[What is Anti-Oppressive Improv?]{.underline}

We follow some basic principles:

-   Challenge Stereotypes

    -   Stereotypes are dehumanising and perpetuate prejudice.

    -   If you see a stereotype on stage, try to give it depth, or
        > develop an explanation for why it is that way.

-   Play from personal experience

    -   Performing characters based on other marginalised people's
        > experiences is appropriation of voice.

    -   Play characters that are inspired from your personal experience.

-   Seek a state of play where everybody is listening, and everyone is
    > leading.

    -   Power structures perpetuate oppression.

    -   We are all leaders, and we are all followers. In this way we
        > break apart hierarchies and model a way of life that focuses
        > on the collective rather than the individual.

-   Acknowledge Biases

    -   Improv and impulse training brings our subconscious biases to
        > the surface, and allows us to re-examine problematic beliefs
        > that we have internalised through lifetimes of societal
        > conditioning.

-   Welcome diversity

    -   We welcome people from all walks of life to participate and
        > invite everyone to lend their voices, share their stories, and
        > contribute to the improv troupe.

CHASING THEMES!

When a theme is introduced, how can we explore it?

Explore it by offering differing opinions of it - we need to show that
we understand each perspective

We can totally drill themes - make the problem about the theme.

Find out why your character has this perspective

Game: pick an issue. RACISM

Give it a metaphor. COLOURS.

Each player picks a perspective.

Play an open scene, knowing how everyone feels.

The scene ends when the oppressive side learns the other's perspective,
or when they agree to disagree, or when they kill each other.

DIRECTING IS HUGE: 5 weeks later at the market when... so it doesn't get
stale

Meanwhile = CROW

Scene set in a kitchen - play around with food while we improvise

How does internal conflict connect with 3 act structure

Questions

-   What makes a good objective? I want \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_.

NEXT SESSION

-   How to set the scene up for longform success

    -   Practice using "meanwhiles" that give the scene space, and start
        > something new

        -   E.g.

    -   

-   

SESSION #8

    -   

-   

Session #7

TO TEACH

-   DEFINITELY give disclaimer of trigger warnings before we play open
    > scenes, whenever we have an audience. Also, designate an active
    > listener. "All of this is improvised, so just be aware that yes we
    > can control content, but we can't predict content. If something
    > comes up that makes you uncomfortable, or feel unsafe, or triggers
    > any negative feelings for you that you need to express, we have
    > \_\_\_\_ in the room *(and that person waves)* and they are here
    > for you 100% of the time. If anything like that does happen, we
    > apologise in advance."

#???????

-   How to be a director

    -   Watch for stereotypes

        -   #list stereotypes

    -   Call scene/time changes when the scene needs it

        -   In a moment of crisis

    -   Reasons to call "sing-about-it"

        -   An "I want" song.

        -   Internal conflict

        -   Anthem

-   Make a list of common stereotypes to look out for

    -   #examples people have observed from past sessions

        -   Women in the kitchen

        -   The scene with the "needy lovers" came across as homophobic!
            > :(

        -   Old people as crippled, or backwards

        -   A Genie: "I'll give you 3 wishes!"

        -   A Frenchman - smoking and being stuck-up / snobbish

        -   Buff gym person

        -   Bossy/baggy woman

        -   Nerdy / antisocial, bullied because they\'re smart

        -   Drug users wacky

        -   Homeless people being drug addicts

        -   Acting gangsta

-   3 act structure

    -   In 3 lines demonstrate:

        -   the problem that everyone in the scene is dealing with

            -   Pick a social justice problem

            -   Pick who is to blame

        -   how that problem reaches a climax

            -   Highest possible stakes.

        -   What the resolution?

            -   

    -   Eg X

        -   Politicians cut corners on water safety to save money,
            > poisoning thousands of children in Flint Michigan

        -   Politicians try to unsuccessfully silence the community who
            > bands together to clean up the water

        -   The rest of the world intervenes.

    -   Eg X

        -   The media stereotype all kittens as terrorists

        -   Kittens are placed in internment camps

        -   The media takes responsibility

    -   Eg X

        -   Corporations are underpaying cats, and they can't afford
            > rent

        -   The cats strike and protest, and the police show up and
            > attack them

        -   Everyone goes back to work

    -   Eg X

        -   The government tells citizens that aliens are real

        -   We get caught infiltrating the secret lab and discover the
            > truth

        -   We join the government

    -   Eg X

        -   Poverty is causing people to starve to death in large
            > numbers

        -   The rebels besiege the palace

        -   The wealthy corporations are overthrown.

    -   Eg X

        -   The corrupt prison system is under review

        -   The guards burn all the evidence and claim it was a riot

        -   Nothing changes

    -   E.g X

        -   We are poor farmers, and our last cow just died.

        -   A banker comes to foreclose the farm, but we hold him
            > hostage for ransom.

        -   The banker sees how we live and decides to personally
            > finance our farm.

-   Internal Conflict

    -   I want to (active verb) \_\_\_\_ but I (active verb)\_\_\_\_\_\_
        > because I believe \_\_\_ .

    -   What do these conflicts mean?

    -   Eg X

        -   I want to become rich, but I'm a shopaholic, because I
            > believe things will make me happy

    -   Eg X

        -   *I want to help the homeless, but I'm incredibly greedy,
            > because I believe that money will keep me safe*

    -   Eg X

        -   I want my sister to be happy, but I put her down, because I
            > believe that homosexuality is a sin

    -   Eg X

        -   I want to make people happy, but I make everyone sad,
            > because I believe I'm depressed

-   Stakes

    -   If I don't \_\_\_\_, then \_\_\_\_

    -   E.g.

        -   If I don't stop this wedding, the couple will be miserable
            > forever.

    -   E.g.

        -   If I don't make \$1000 by tomorrow, I lose my house.

-   Note-taking!

    -   **Remembering character names**

        -   **Name tags!!**

    -   

-   Using conventions to help the players instead of messing with them

-   Improvised set and costume design

            > make offensive statements.

        -   Jokes at the expense of you, not other people

    -   Challenge Stereotypes

        -   If you notice a character becoming a stereotype, find a way
            > to challenge that stereotype and show depth.

    -   Active listeners / mental health first aid in the room.

    -   Non verbal scenes to accommodate language barriers

Nocturne GROUP HUGS DEBRIEF

What worked?

-   The combination of "group hugs" and "meet a stranger" signs made
    > strangers hug when there was nobody there

-   Need at least 3 people to start a hug...

-   Lighting for the sign is important. Also, hanging the sign up high

-   

Actions for future

-   Make stand alone art installations around halifax

    -   Make a list of rules for group hugs

        -   Consent: you can say no

        -   Diagram for best group hug positions

        -   

    -   Write up about how this project started and the theory behind it

        -   Isolation

    -   

-   

Theory:

-   Capitalism / individualism vs CONNECTING

    -   (consensual) hugging is connecting.

    -   Capitalism divides, makes us individuals, social etiquette
        > prevents us from connecting. Hugs combat that.

    -   Symbolism. Together we are strong and warm and held

-   Creating commons\...reclaiming our right to the city.

    -   Making public spaces more inviting\...an opportunity to connect

    -   Giving us a reason/excuse to gather

    -
