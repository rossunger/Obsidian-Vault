STORY
Come home to yourself. 

Travel with us to other dimensions in search of new perspectives, missing pieces, ancestoral memories

let us come home to ourselves, together

Workshops during the day
Sacred fire all the time. Lodges once or twice a day.
Feast. 
Light social time in between workshops
Dancing and music at night? ecstatic dance...concerts

brittany: something about chakras... each day is a focus on a specific chakra?
