Trauma Game

These are snippets/fragments of thoughts about trauma.

I am imagining these being part of an interactive experience

I’ve just been writing down thoughts on a page, but they need to be reordered and shaped to create a curated experience

I’m trying to decide if I should invite contributions from others. If you have any thoughts, please feel free to add them at the bottom!

  
  

From the moment that you’re born, you experience trauma

  

You internalise it in your body, setting up triggers to warn you of impending danger

  

You develop fears, that steer you away from things that want to hurt you

  

You put up walls to protect yourself against the raging storm

  

And then one day you wake up, and you realise something’s wrong

  

I’m a normal person. I’m sure of it. I mean, I’m special, and I’m the center of my own universe, but for all intents and purposes, I’m a normal person. 

  

I used to look at all the awful things that happen to people and reflect “nothing bad has ever happened to me. Nobody that I care deeply about has ever died, I’ve never had any intense injuries, no surgery or anything”

  

I used to see people act in bizarre ways, and talk about what they’ve been through, and I’d think “wow. You are so broken. I want to help”

  

My first partner felt unsafe around their parents. We were 16. They lived with me and my parents for a few months. We had problems. At the time it seemed pretty clear that THEY had problems, but in truth WE had problems. Hindsight’s 20 20.

  

I remember one night when things felt particularly unbearable for me, I wanted to hurt myself because I didn’t know what else to do. I found their razor, and cut. I’d never used a razor before. My thought process was “Where can I cut that won’t kill me or cause me any long term damage...and maybe somewhere where people won’t notice it...can’t be anywhere near my hand or arms, because I’m a musician and I need those…” The cuts were painless. At first I thought that it hadn’t worked, so I tried again. A few second later blood started pouring from my chest. Then it started stinging. I’m not gonna lie, it felt good. It helped. I remember thinking “I hope it scars a little, so I never forget this moment. It can be a memento to remind me of how bad things get”.

  

Trauma makes you act in funny ways. 

  

I feel like the word trauma wasn’t used so much until a few years ago. I first noticed it in 2012 when trigger warnings suddenly became all the rage. Before then, nobody really talked about it. At least not to me. 

  

I remember feeling alienated. It’s not that I had a problem with content warnings or all this talk about trauma, I just hadn’t realised that so many people are traumatised. It seemed that everyone was dealing with some sort of trauma. My worldview was shifting, and my privilege was beginning to show. When it came to trauma, I mostly shut my mouth and listened. After all, what could *I* have to say about trauma?

  

I met a traveller passing through my home town. We had a short romance, and then they swept me up and took me home with them. I was to be a “housewife”. It seemed like a good idea. 

  

I had experienced abusive relationships before, but nothing quite like this. I was trapped, and all alone, and it went from bad to worse, and worse to awful. Yelling, insults, manipulation, lying, cheating, you name it. I can’t imagine how I stayed.

  

My first real encounter with the concept of childhood trauma happened near the end of our brutal 2 year relationship. We had asked a friend to mediate, and afterwards they offered to try this thing with me. They said “I want you to feel the pain in your body. Let it fill you up. And now ask your body, when is the first time that I felt this”

  

I remember preschool. I was 3, didn’t speak a word of English. I remember walking around confused. Why did they leave me here? Who are all these people? What do they want from me. I remember crying. “Please don’t go. I’m not ready. I don’t want to stay here”

  

I remember hiding under a blanket. I must have been 4. My logic was that if she can’t find me to say goodbye, then she can’t leave. I really didn’t want her to leave. Grandpa was a scary stranger and I really didn’t want her to leave.

  

I don’t remember much about my first year of school. There was one time my mom had packed me cheese sandwiches. I hated cheese. At lunch time I tried to throw them in the trash, but the teacher caught me. I couldn’t explain to her that I didn’t want them. She made me eat them. Another time, after school, all the parents came to pick their kids up, but nobody came for me. I sat there by myself, crying. 

  

Remembering these things changed something for me. It was the first time I saw myself as broken. It was the first time that I acknowledged to myself that beneath this veneer of confidence and independence is a blubbering mess of a child that never really learned to trust people. 

  

In the midst of the break up I made a friend who taught me a lot about consent. I had heard about concept in relation to sexuality, but I had never really experienced it viscerally. I thought “consent is when someone wants to have sex with you” or something. 

  

But then I met this person who blew my mind. All my life I had felt tense about communicating with people; I never felt understood. I’m sure it stemmed from my childhood trauma. As a result, I had learned to talk to people in manipulative ways. Most of us do. But consent is magic. It has the power to break the cycle of control and manipulation. It’s easy really. You just interact with people like you really care about them. If you sense they’re not comfortable with something, or having a hard time expressing what they’re feeling, you stop what you’re doing, and try to help them. You ask them gentle questions. You reassure them that it’s ok to take as long as they need to process their thoughts and feelings. And you wait. You wait. You wait until they’re ready. And gosh it feels good. On both sides.

  

I remember the first time I was able to feel safe saying “It’s really awkward for me when you say I love you, because I’m worried that you want me to say it back, and I’m not sure if I feel the same way as you and then I’m worried I’ll be leading you on, and actually, you know how we keep cuddling and it get’s a little sexual? I’m not sure I’m wanting that”

  

I discovered NVC in 2017 when I became close with someone who has helped me identify and heal some of the most insidious traumas. Non violent communication - a book that talks about the way we communicate with each other that are traumatising us. It’s not the be-all and end-all that some people say, but it’s definitely a philosophy that has saved my life. 

  

When I see you check your phone in the middle of an emotional conversation, I feel scared, and angry, because I’m needing to feel safe that you appreciate how vulnerable what I’m saying is and to know that you are hearing me and taking me seriously, and understanding the urgency of my words. Would you be willing to refrain from checking your phone while we talk about whether or not you’re going to break up with me and go back to Australia?

  

That sounds really hard. I’m really wanting to give you my full attention and to make you feel safe. However, I’m also needing to check my phone because I’m expecting a call from my mother who I haven’t seen in 3 years. Maybe we could have this conversation another time?

  

We manipulate people because we’re scared. We make deals, commitments, contracts; we design collateral - can you commit to moving in with me? ...because then I’ll feel safe that you’re not just wasting my time leading me on. Why don’t we just start with “I have trauma around people leading me on. I got really hurt this one time and I never fully recovered. Do you think you could help me see how this is going to be different so that I can feel safe with you?”

  

As we go further down the rabbithole I realise that any commitment is manipulation. It takes away agency. 

  

We ask people to commit to things because we're scared. Behind every manipulation is a fear. Behind every fear is trigger. Behind every trigger is a trauma. Behind every trauma is a need that wasn’t met sometime. And we all have the same needs; we need to feel safe, we need to feel useful, we need to feel seen, and understood, and accepted, and so on. Seeing the need behind the fear makes it easier to feel compassionate. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

I realised one day that I was seriously considering adopting a new identity to escape from an abusive situation. 

  

I had a friend who loved to rant about how people are overusing the word trauma. I think she’s wrong. I think the opposite is true. I think we need to use it more. To accept that we're broken so that we can start to heal instead of sweeping our Trauma under the rug

  

#I believe survivors

  

I realised one day that I was living the life of a fugitive. I wouldn’t tell people where I lived. I walked around with a hood on my head. I stopped people from tagging me in social media posts. I wanted to be a ghost. That’s not right. It’s a broken thing to do. It got to the point where I had several emergency plans in my brain, in case they found out where I lived. I knew whose car I would borrow, which route I would take to be least noticed, because, you know that if this person finds out where you live, you’ll have to move.

  

And I know it’s irrational, because the problem is so small. It’s a few thousand dollars. Maybe less. But when there’s trauma there, it feels insurmountable. 

  

I’m not generally the kind of person to avoid dealing with something. I like to get things out of the way. I call it “upgrading”. The sooner you get something off your plate, the less time you  spend worrying about getting it done, and the more time you have to reap the benefits that yields.

  

I think the first step to healing trauma is recognising what’s going. It’s gotten pretty easy now to know whether something I’m feeling is reasonable or a trauma response (hint: it’s almost always a trauma response). Once you get to a place where you can catch it fast enough, then you can just tell people that you’re feeling triggered and you need help. This way it’s easy to take responsibility for your feelings. 

  

A trauma trigger is your body responding to an experience that in some way reminds you of something that happened in the past that was very damaging. It’s a defense mechanism. Your body is telling you “that was REALLY bad. We HAVE to avoid it”. Sometimes it’s rational and it’s there to help you. “This person act in abusive ways. Stay away from them”. Sometimes it gets it wrong “this person seems similar to that other person who was abusive. They might be abusive too”. 

  

It becomes a lot harder to identify the trauma when it’s old, and buried under layers of assumption and beliefs. These past few months I have been forced to dig deep and it’s hard to believe how deep the rabbit-hole goes

  

My dad used to yell. It wasn’t very often, maybe a few times a year. Sometimes he’d slam the table. I think I was a teenager when I realised that this wasn’t ok. I’d never really thought about how this affected me. It’s funny, in the past 10 years he’s mellowed out a bit. Now he just gets sad. 

  
  
  

It’s gets pretty bad when you share a life with someone who triggers you, especially if you’re triggering them too. We all have traumas, but sometimes our traumas line up in such a way that provokes disaster. 

  

My last partner had anger problems. When we were really trying to make it work, we had developed some mantras. “Sad not mad” was one of her. Trying to allow yourself to feel sadness instead of anger. Anger was a trigger for me. 

  
  
  

It's amazing how trauma is stored in our body. I discovered several childhood memories that I had forgotten while receiving a massage around my lower back area. As the fingers touch my flesh I had a sudden pain that wasn't quite muscle pain. It felt like they were penetrating my kidneys, and I had a sudden flash of a memory of when I was a child, and I fell off a swing and got injured. I had watched there's some other kids doing this trick where they swing really high and then jump off and land on their feet, except I didn't land on my feet. I landed on my back. I think this was my body reminding me to play safe, and question my judgements and measurements. 

  
  
  

It’s important to know your limits, and to communicate them clearly. The worst triggering of my life happened with a person who I felt safest with. They didn’t realise until it was too late. As I lay there trembling for the next few hours, I wondered how did I get here? How did I become this broken? How do I make it through and become whole again?

  

Sometimes I think it’s not me. Like, somehow the whole world is going through a trauma. I mean, I know it is, but sometimes I think it’s linked. Like I’d be going through this no matter what, even if nothing was wrong. Like fate or something. Or universal consciousness. It helps to think that. Makes me feel less alone. Even if it's not true.

  

Sometimes I freeze up. I know what I should do, and I know that there’s no reason not to do it, but I can’t move. And I don’t really believe that I’m frozen. I look at myself and I think “why are you just sitting there? Why are you pretending? You’re being manipulative. Stop it. Just get up and go”. But for some reason I can’t move my limbs. It’s like something in my body overrides my motor controls. 

  

The other day I had the worst triggering of my life. I was having a conversation with an intimate partner, and they misunderstood something I was saying and became emotionally closed off and angry. They got up and started working on a painting in the middle of the conversation. When I asked them questions about what was going on they gave one word answers and refused to help me understand. At first I had it under control. I breathed, remained calm. Kept asking questions to try to understand. And then it started creeping in. I'm not sure what came first or how fast it happened, but I became a hyperventilation, trembling, mess. My head began throbbing, and i kept saying “I can't go through this again.” Even now as I think about it I twitch a little, remembering the feeling.

  

There’s something insidious that happens when you feel broken; you become a no person. Someone asks you if you want to *blank* and your first impulse is “No!”. You’re body tenses up and your brain is running through all the possibilities of how this suggestion is going to hurt you. 

  
  
  
  

There’s a point where trauma and privilege clash. As I sit here, with basic financial security, kind supportive roommates and a good living situation, zero obligations and responsibilities, it is incredibly hard to feel like my trauma is valid. Sure, it’s a challenge to leave the house now, and sure, I’m scared that any moment they’ll find me and harass me, but really, things could be a lot worse. It’s not like anything REALLY bad happened. I’m not dying, I’m not going to jail, I’m not dealing with racism, or poverty, or any other truly awful experience. And yet I feel broken. I feel scared. I feel like I wish I was dead. Not all the time. But often enough. 

  

Sometimes I’m able to structure my day in a way that makes me forget, and it’s almost like living a normal life. I play my cello, I cook some food, I watch educational videos, I talk to one or two of the six people that feel safe in my life right now, I dream of what I want to be doing with my life. If I manage to do this a few days in a row, life almost starts feeling normal again. 

  

But then you get a text. Or an email. Or someone asks you about it. And it all comes flooding back. 

  
  

Everything in my life right now seems to come down to one theme: isolation. 

  

I’ve been looking for companionship… a life partner. Someone who wants to engage in my life-work with me. I realised today that this is a cry for help for someone to help me heal my life trauma...abandonment issues. We all need help healing.

  

It’s too much to ask an individual to help you. What I’m really needing is community. 

  
  

I’ve decided that trauma is going to be the focus of my work in the near future. Everything seems to boil down to trauma

  
  
  
  

Walls are the first gatekeepers to trauma. they prevent you from being vulnerable. They keep out anything that's real. They stop you from feeling.

  

Sometimes walls come in the form of silence. If you don't say anything, then the problem doesn't exist

  

Sometimes walls come in the form of jokes, or other distractions. If we are laughing things can't be serious, right? Look over there! A monkey!

  

Busyness is a wall

  

Sometimes walls are mirrors, deflecting every attempt at closeness. Sometimes walls are hard to see, and we need someone to hold up a mirror to show us what we're doing. 

  

Sometimes walls come in the shape of masks. Different Identities that we wear with different people in order to control what parts of us they see. Masks help us blend in, or stand out, whichever takes us further from the pain 

  

Why do I wear so many masks? Is it Trauma? Is it because I don't believe that people will see me or accept me if I show them myself? that would be unbearable 

  
  
  

Fear is the second gatekeeper to trauma. Fears keep you away from things that might hurt you. They steer your decisions. They seem rational. Theyre like magnets, pulling you towards what's safe, and pushing you away from the bad stuff. 

  
  

Then come triggers. Triggers warn you SERIOUSLY STOP. Triggers don't really give you a choice. They're a final failsafe to stop you dead in your tracks. Without them we might fall off a cliff and plunge to our death. They take the form of anxiety attacks, paralysis, disassociation.

  
  
  

My parents were immigrants, but they were never TRULY poor. There was a time when they had nothing, but they were in a wealthy country that had a great welfare system, so they were doing alright. Their parents, however, were holocaust survivors, and they had been through the kind of poverty that become a lifelong trauma, so it’s not surprising that when they raised my parents, they ingrained some pretty intense habits and ideas. That’s what I think of as generational trauma. And of course, my parents never really healed, so they passed it down to me. 

  

It’s hard to explain how this trauma is more than just thoughts and beliefs; I feel it in my bones. I live my life anticipating scarcity at any moment. I see people spend money and it gives me anxiety. I’m like “are you crazy?!”. I live on 600 a month including rent, and it wasn’t until I had 5 digits in my bank account that I stopped feeling like I was broke. It wasn’t until I had 50K that I felt like I could buy myself a treat. You never know when you’ll be in trouble, and then you’ll be glad you have that safety net. I can’t decide  if that’s a rational trauma, looking out for me - cos the world is a treacherous place -, or if it’s just a poverty mentality that’s preventing me from enjoying life. A bit of both I suppose 

  

Then there’s societal trauma. Like, take for example time. Ever since post-industrial capitalism took the reigns and we started worshipping productivity people have become slaves to time. I realised this recently - so many of my problems stemmed from time related pressures; Any time I want to do more, and better, and faster, and wishing I was somewhere else - this is all becomes of time. Judging if what was worth my time, feeling frustrated if I had to slow down and wait for someone or something. And it’s because I’m worried that if I don’t hurry, I’m going to fall  behind, and that when I look back on my life, lying on my death bed, I’ll be somehow disappointed. It’s toxic. It’s made up. It trauma. 

  
  
  

There’s a part of me that believes that our purpose on earth, across many lives, is to heal the traumas of our souls...that life gives us traumas that resemble our soul traumas to help us practice letting go and healing. Another part of me thinks I’m crazy..

  
  

Today I was reading about how people with abandonment trauma have a tendency to repeatedly subject themselves to people or experiences that lead to another loss, another rejection, and another trauma. I’m scared that this is what happens to me. I don’t want it to be true. Why does this happen?

  

I’ve been thinking a lot about the concept of circles. I’ve been connecting with several ingenious spiritualities that all talk about circles. Or more accurately spirals

Maybe I find myself inadvertently reliving and recreating my traumas again and again not because I'm repeating mistakes, but because every time I'm inching closer and closer to recovery. Maybe life keeps giving me the same problems so that I can learn to face them.

  
  
  

A reality that is very hard to accept, is that due to societal pressures and systemic injustice, most of us are forced to act in violent ways. Not physically violent, but traumatising. We are unable to take the time to truly hear each other, to communicate compassionately, to spend an hour talking about feelings that we don’t understand

  
  

In childhood we learn how to put up walls, and this knowledge get trapped in our subconscious. If we are to have any hope of inner peace, we have to learn how to do this by choice. 

  

Putting up a wall is like taking painkillers. It’s like waving magic wand to silence a gaggle of screaming children when your tired heart can’t take it anymore. It’s a temporary relief from the chronic pain of fear and trauma. 

  

Sometimes the walls are not enough. Some onslaughts pierce even the hardest metals.

  
  

I am realising that we really only get traumatized when we interact with others and the world around us. And then we get into the problem where one trauma exacerbates the other and forms a positive feedback loop. Trauma train. If you go back far enough you'll find how a seemingly insignificant action caused the long chain of events that exploded into a terrible nightmare. Interlocking traumas. When you said you were going to sleep, I was triggered because I had experienced abandonment trauma involving sleep, and when I communicated that I was upset, you were triggered because you had experienced trauma around denial of sleep, so you told me that I was being abusive, which was triggering for me because I had experienced trauma around gaslighting. We need to find a way to stop traumatising each other, and to see other people's violent actions as traumas of their own

  
  

A lot of Trauma comes from being misunderstood. My brother has undiagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder. As a young child he would tell me parents that everything was scary. When they tried to feed him food, he was scared, and they thought he was being a brat. I can't imagine how intensely that kinda thing can scar your

  
  

With the dawn of the internet age everyone started self-diagnosing medical conditions. You always find that you have two or three of the more generic symptoms, and you freak out “oh no! I have depression! Or maybe I'm pregnant”. So I didn't think much of it when my close friends told me she thought I had Asperger's. It wasn't until I looked at the list of symptoms that I realised, that “normal” people don't experience the world the way that I do.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

I keep trying to find the source of my traumas but it's always just out of reach. I'm remembering my mom ignoring me when I needed her. 

  
  
  

Navigating the mental health system is a nightmare. It takes months if not years to get connected with someone who can help you, and it costs an arm and a leg. And is they're not a good fit, it can discourage people from seeking further help. But help us what we need. Mental health support is a human right. Its a basic necessity. Like food. And air. And we're all suffocating. 

  

What we really need is peer support. It should be a societal duty to emotionally support each other. Seeing a mental health professional is one thing, but we need people who are constant in our life, who have the tools and capacity to hold space and provide  the support that we need to work on making ourselves. 

  

I think in many cases it is too dangerous to try to heal a trauma on your own. I have led myself into awful states trying to untangle knots of pain. there are traumas that are too big to handle on our own, and we need a little help. It’s okay to ask for help. It has to be ok. 

  

But most people don't know how to help. How would they? Nobody teaches us these things. Nobody gives us the tools we need.Sometimes we rely on our partners to help us. And often they let us down. We have to realise that they have trauma of their own.

  
  

And then there are the traumas that make no sense. The ones you don’t understand. And once you find out they exists, it’s like, what do I do with this?? 

  
  

One of the great pains with trauma is that you feel like everyone is blaming you for being traumatised. Sometimes people don't believe you, or belittle your trauma. Sometimes people get upset with you for needing support. Sometimes people give you false hope of support, and lead you down a chasm of despair when you don't have capacity to deal with it. 

  
  

I read a book that talked about the way trauma gets stuck in your body. Apparently fight or flight responses actually have a third component. Freeze. If you can’t fight or run away in the face of danger, your body freezes in the hope that your predators will assume you’re dead and continue hunting leaving you a small window of time to run away. To snap out of it, you tremble, shaking it out. But if you don’t do that, that’s when trauma gets trapped in your body.

  

I’ve been searching for ways to let go of trauma. 

  

Spirituality, ritual, ceremony. These are the way that I have found through trauma. Community, holding space for one another. Trust; Prayer; Faith; these are the anvils on which freedom is forged. 

  

I have found great comfort in the knowledge that sometimes my trauma is bigger than me. Like, past life stuff, or generational. It’s not about me. There’s a deep relief that comes from that. Like, I didn’t screw this up. This isn’t my fault

  

I started having Panic attacks. Knowing that I was about  relive a nightmare, I would freeze up, and then I would start hyperventilating, and then suddenly my body would take over and a peace would settle over me. My body would be thrashing, I'd be frothing at the mouth, but inside I'm smiling thinking "thank goodness, I can just observe now". The distress and paralysis became so unbearable that the thought of losing control over my body was a relief. 

  

People witnessing these panic attacks described them as demons leaving my body. Talking in tongues. Frothing at the mouth. They were really scared.

  
  

There are all kinds of medicines out there. #ayahuasca

  

It takes a certain kinda person to help you rewrite deeply painful narratives. They have to be prepared to hurt you, to recreate your worst nightmares, so that you can relive everything that went wrong but have the ending you’ve always dreamed of. I don’t know if this is a healthy way to work through trauma, but it’s one that worked for me. 

  
  

I think in one way or another, anyone who heals their trauma is a healer and is destined to help others. When you've lived through that experience and made it to the other side, you have a unique perspective that allows you to see things that weren't there before. 

  

Nothing ever really goes away. You don't just fix things and suddenly everything's fine. It's like a scar. A memento of a darker time. Every now and then it flares up, reminding you of everything you've been through, and sure it hurts a little, but it's a familiar pain, and you know you've got nothing to be afraid of.

  
  

We don't really talk much about shared trauma. The trauma of surviving colonisation. The trauma of industrial capitalism. The trauma of toxic masculinity. The trauma of climate crisis. These are tangible pains, and the root cause of most suffering. It's hard to make time and hold space for trauma that you can't do anything about. Not on your own. Not in a single lifetime.

  

Trauma work can become all consuming, and it's tempting to put all your efforts into fixing the problem, but we have to make room for celebration. For remembering why we're alive. For marking our achievements. To look out over everything we've accomplished and feel the gratitude. There will always be more to work on. 

  
  

#making art is trauma

  
  

Sometime when things don't work out quite as you planned them it can feel like your world is falling apart. Especially if there were other people depending on you. You go from feeling on top of the world, like anything is possible, to awkwardly melting into yourself, wondering why you should even bother opening your eyes again. You start to question your intentions; was I just 

  

Trauma is exhausting. Your body starts hurting in places you didn’t know you had, and you’re tired even though you haven’t done anything. It’s like having a parasite sucking out your life force.

  

Trauma is like a bear. They say if you see a bear you should back away slowly, make calm low sounds, and maybe climb a tree, unless of course it’s a grizzly bear in which case you should run as fast as you can. In most cases, the bear is just as scared of you as you are of bear. Bear is also medicine. Trauma can be terrifying if you know what it can do to you.

  

My ancestors were jews. They had everything taken away from them again and again and again. People hated us because we were good with wealth. They killed us. They stole everything we needed to survive. The cast us out of their communities. I carry that trauma in my bones. When someone threatens my livelihood, it all comes flooding to the surface. all my anscestor’s pain in every cell of my body. Generations of wisdom, reminding me of what could happen at any moment. 

  
  

It’s strange, the way that trauma leaves your body sometimes. It’s like when your ears are plugged after swimming underwater, and you your hopping on one foot trying to get them to pop, but it’s not happening, and you go on with your life, just living with it, and every now and then you trying the hopping thing again, but it doesn’t help, and so you just forget about it, and it assimilates, becomes part of you normal, and you go on like this for an indeterminate amount of time as if nothings wrong, and then one day it pops, and you can hear again. It’s like a weight getting lifted off your shoulders. Or when you’ve been standing on your head for too long, and all the blood has rushed to your head, and then you stand up too quickly, and for a moment, you’re dizzy as hell, and you don’t know which way is up, and you think you might vomit, but you don’t, and a few seconds later it’s like nothing was ever wrong. 

  
  

It’s hard to believe the way that trauma distorts your memories. Not so much the facts - that’s normal - but the memory of what it felt like. Trauma pours a bucket of black paint on everything you hold dear. People who loved you become hostiles, things you loved doing become apathy, and there’s a barbed wire fence erected to protect you from ever trying to re-examine these memories. But time is a powerful sage, and when you’re ready to re-enter the garden, you’ll find the fence has conveniently rusted away, and a gentle push grants you access to a part of you that has been locked away for safe-keeping.

  
  
  

  

TRAUMA GAME DESIGN

  

-   Walls are barriers that prevent you from engaging with trauma
    

-   They prevent you from seeing trauma (both yours and others’) 
    
-   There are cracks in the walls that give you hints of what’s behind them
    
-   There are ways to bring down these walls.
    
-   Masks are walls that act as mirrors, deflecting your attention elsewhere
    

-   Fears are forces that guide you away from traumas. These could be:
    

-   Roads that lead you somewhere,
    
-   Wind, 
    
-   Gravity
    
-   Magnets
    
-   People that we’re drawn to / repelled by, 
    
-   Familiarity
    
-   Friction,
    
-   Buoyancy
    
-   Thrust
    
-   Momentum
    
-   Spectacle
    
-   Aesthetics
    
-   Springs 
    

-   Triggers are the alarm bells that tell you TRAUMA IS HERE
    

-   They’re not always rational: sometime’s your body misinterpreted a past trauma and created the wrong trigger
    
-   They’re very difficult to control. You can only do it if you have capacity
    
-   They are urgent, and you can’t function until you deal with them
    
-   If you dig deep, you’ll find memories that help you understand the trigger
    

-   Types of trauma
    

-   Physical injury
    
-   Emotional abuse
    
-   Generational
    
-   Societal
    

  
  
  

Aim of the game

-   Heal from trauma
    

  

Goals

-   Disarm all the irrational triggers. Do this by solving each fear’s puzzles. Access these puzzle and clues to solving them by taking down walls.
    

  

Gameplay

-   There are walls, with cracks in them. 
    
-   When you find a way to take down the walls, you are able to enter the room. Each room is a fear.
    
-   Inside each room there are triggers. Some triggers are rational, others are not. If you disarm a rational trigger, you will be re-traumatised. This will make your life harder (new triggers appear? Some sort of impairment?)
    
-   There can be fears inside fears
    
-   The whole game is a giant fear, and once you deactivate all the trigger, the outside walls open up to reveal a beautiful view 
    
-   As you deactivate triggers and release fears, you become lighter, and rise up the Y axis...taking you close to the “chimney”. 
    
-   Walls attack outsiders. 
    
-   Triggers are alarm bells, flashing lights, police, paralisers, 
    
-   Like being mind controlled. Fighting to be good but your fears take over. Terminator style
    
-   Talking to your parts
    

  

UI

-   Floating picture frame with memory...when you connect with it (touch it? Put your face in it?) the scene changes to show you the memory
    
-   Walls have cracks in them. They also have power meters. When you turn down the power they disolve. 
    
-   Trauma makes the ground shake
    
-   Haptic feedback for when things happen to that are triggering
    
-   Walls...first you just take them down...then you learn to put them up… then you learn to move them...then you learn to build them
    
-     
    

  

Puzzles

-   Axes of symmetry
    
-   Mirrors: how many people can you see from each location on a grid?
    
-   Using/placing mirrors to direct light into the cracks? Collect mirrors from other puzzles
    
-   Something about circles and spirals?
    
-   2 player / 2 character? One person moves the mirrors, the other tells them what to do
    

  

Types of Trauma

-   Abandoment
    
-   Parent violence
    
-   Intimate partner emotional abuse
    
-     
    

  

Tutorial

-   You wake up in a room surrounded by 4 walls and no door.
    

  

  
Story

-   From the moment that you’re born, you experience trauma
    
-   You internalise it in your body, setting up triggers to warn you of impending danger
    
-   You develop fears, that steer you away from things that want to hurt you
    
-   You put up walls to protect yourself against the raging storm
    
-   And then one day you wake up, and you realise something’s wrong
    

  

What experience are we trying to create?

-   That moment when you realise that you've been acting irrationally
    

-     
    

-   That moment when you realise you're broken/traumated
    

-   When you realise that YOU are the one creating all these lasers
    

-   That moment when you realise that you've fucked someone up
    

-   You hear someone being triggered by your action as a voiceover
    

-   That moment when you realise you've been avoiding dealing with your shit forever
    

-   You discover that you need to work through all the walls you put up
    

-   That moment when you're triggered and you can't move
    

-   You're in a chair that's sinking into a lava pit, and your character won't move

1 Jan 2018

-   Today I tried the game in VR for the first time since creating the mirrors and laser
    
-   Mirrors look GREAT. Laser is a little crappy, but whatevs. 
    
-   Tried to make the mirrors interactable...didn’t work too well
    
-   Set up laser trigger to turn laser on and off
    

  

2 Jan 2018

-   Implemented magnet :) very easy and quick
    
-   Modelled a concave and convex lens
    
-   Brainstormed beam-splitter
