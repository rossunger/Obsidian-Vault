[[Hoeven]] was possibly the most respected artist of this generation. Their
work explored issues of connection and isolation, and they were one of
the few artists whose work transcended class and race and gender. As
they prepared to go on stage for a lecture on life and art below the
blackout line, they couldn't help but reflect on their humble
beginnings. If it hadn't been for their dear friend [[Dr Joseph Calamarino|Joseph]], they may
never have pursued art at all.

They wondered if Jo Cam considered them a friend. They hadn't seen each
other for almost a year, and Hoeven could never really tell what Joseph
was feeling. They resolved to visit him the minute they got a chance.

The applause from the auditorium signaled that it was time to head
onstage. Hoeven was a superstar, but they couldn't decide if they
enjoyed all this attention, or if they'd prefer to run away and live in
a forest. Being famous made it really difficult to make art about human
connection. You couldn't just show up and blend in. Every interaction
has a layer of doubt where you can never be sure if someone is being
real with you or just starstruck.

HOEVEN
I know these talks normally start with the artist telling about themselves, but I suppose you've all read my autobiography? Professor [[Dean Jefferson|Dean]] tells me it's assigned reading? So I'm just gonna shuffle things up and start with questions. Do you have any questions? Yes, you, with orange scarf "

STUDENT
What's life like, you know, down there?

HOEVEN
What? Go read the autobiography. Anyone else? Blue bag, 3rd row

[[JESSICA]]
Jessica. How do feel that your success has affected the people in your
community, and do you feel responsible for any of the harm caused?

HOEVEN
I don't have a community. The people I grew up with always laughed at
me before I was famous, and resent me now that I'm rolling in the
dough, so to speak. My mother was the only one who ever made me feel
supported growing up. But to answer your question more broadly, I think
the whole thing has attracted poverty pimps who developed a tourism
industry which simultaneously feeds and exploits anyone who's ever
associated with me, and overall I'd say their lives are better off, but
it's not really my place to judge, and I'm sure there are many who are
angry and offended by it all. Very good question. Important to be
thinking about it, but hard to have any impact on the matter.

JESSICA
What about Joseph Camilleri?

HOEVEN
What about him?

JESSICA
Isn't he part of your community? Don't you feel like you've left him
behind? Do you even know how he's doing?

HOEVEN
Yes. I visit him periodically

JESSICA
Are you aware of the impact your departure has had on him?

HOEVEN
Sorry, do you know him personally?

JESSICA
I'm his niece

HOEVEN
i wasn't aware he had a niece

JESSICA
For someone who cites him as a close friend and influence, you don't
seem to know much about him

HOEVEN
How did you end up here?

JESSICA
You're not the only one who transcends boundaries
