[[Tartarama]]'s pursuit of balance had brought them to a healthy place, one
that they hoped to maintain for the rest of their life. After an
explosive childhood of swinging from extreme to extreme, Tartarama found
themselves blazing through a midlife crisis at 19, and they surely would
have fallen off some proverbial cliff had it not been for the
transformational breakdown which engulfed them after the unfortunate
death of their first born child. Perhaps it was the grief that exposed
the true nature of their volatility, or maybe some form of misplaced
guilt. But one way or another, their world stopped, and the puzzle
pieces got re-shuffled. A new cast of characters entered the scene,
leaving room for new possibilities.

In the living of it, Taratarama learned to drive their life like a car,
learning to value second and third gear as constantly alternating
between first and fifth gives you whiplash. Spending so much time with
foreigners taught them to say what they mean, and because their
wellbeing depended on their support, Tartarama also learned to mean what
they say. No more waving words around like a feather duster. No more
suspiciously ambiguous provocations. And much to their surprise,
Tartarama discovered that they had, in fact, a wonderful sense of
humour. It's amazing how much life can change when you let it. Of
course, Taratarama wasn't perfect. They still had occasional outbursts,
and breakdowns. And they surely missed the dramatics. But on the whole,
their life was kinder. Simpler. More in line with who they wished to be.

As they stared at the anxious pilgrim that stood in front of them, they
wondered what affliction had brought them to this sanctuary. Perhaps
they too were finding that their life was falling apart. Tartarama
smiled, the warmest he could muster, and welcomed the pilgrim to their
quarters. [[Shmuli-ka]], their name tag said. Tartarama wanted to tell them
it was all going to be alright, but it was a day of silence at the
[[temple]], so a warm hug would have to do. They could tell that Shmuli-ka
wasn't used to being touched by the way they flinched, but they also
knew, from personal experience, how much a hug from an acolyte could
change the shape of your day.

It's not often that the pilgrims choose to stay at the temple, and those
who do often don't stay long. Their visions send them all across the
city to help in ways that they couldn't possibly have imagined, so it
was strange that Tartarama was still here after all these years. But who
were they to judge? They secretly hoped to stay here forever, avoiding
the calamity of returning to the mundane world, but they knew that
eventually that day would come, and their skills would be put to the
test. All the tools they'd learned, all the rituals, to maintain those
in the real world, that's the real challenge
