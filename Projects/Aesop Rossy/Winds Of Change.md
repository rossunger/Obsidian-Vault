The winds of change are raging,
Staging new beginnings,
Thinning out the weeds of now
that once were cherished dearly for their fruit and flowers,
How do I accept that every season all the islands holding me begin to sink down
Leaving me to flounder till I let myself drown
Escaping to the other side to find a new home
Rake the leaves of friendships with a fine comb
Measure by the pain how much we've all grown
Synchronize our watches and let the time flow
Ride the winds and waves and venture without eyes into the unknown

Watching pretty patterns escalate 
emancipating censored chords 
of censured fjords of feelings that I didn't let my mind know,
tripping up on tangled thoughts that I wouldn't let my mind grow
nipping budding stories lest they manifest all thorny 
into torturous devices
that digest us from inside of us
testing my resolve by peeling heart zest
melting self destructive habits is the hardest
