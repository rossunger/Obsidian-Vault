**EVALUATIONS**

General Thoughts:

-   So important for it to be a non-commercial space. One of few places
    > in halifax you can go that doesn't expect you to spend money

-   6pm start maybe too early? with better outreach we could reach the
    > demographic that would benefit from the earlier start time

-   Potluck vibe was great when it happened, really created a sense of
    > connection and made people feel like they could contribute. Could
    > use more of that. we offered to cover some of the costs of food
    > for folks, but we werent able to consistently rely on folks
    > bringing snacks\...hard to guage how much food we should bring.

-   Should spend more time doing outreach with

    -   BIPOC folks\...current estimate only 10-15% of folks

    -   Teens 12-18 (I think we only had 1?)

    -   Older adults (we had periodically 1 or 2 folks in the 40+ range)

-   Would be ideal to find a physically accessible space

-   Consistency was so important. People knew they could rely on the
    > space and knew what to expect from it.

-   Workshops were good, and it was important to read the
    > room\...sometimes they were unnecessary and it was good to let
    > people just do their own thing.

-   background music and lighting was important to making people feel
    > comfortable and excited to be in the space.

-   Lots of people talked about wanting to come, but were unable to

-   Some people unclear about what the event is (many of these just
    > didn't read the event description!)

-   "Love talking about it as a community living room. It captures the
    > feeling of being there... a really welcoming, non-threatening way
    > to describe what's happening and why we're meeting every week: to
    > feel part of community... and everyone has a living room and knows
    > how they feel in the living room, and know that that's what they
    > can expect in this space"

**[[Christmas Memories]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Snuggled warm in my cozy bed,]{.mark}

[Excitement whirling in my head;]{.mark}

[It's Christmas Eve, with stockings hung,]{.mark}

[And Christmas carols sweetly sung.]{.mark}

[Sounds of secrets from another room]{.mark}

[As gifts are wrapped, to be opened soon.]{.mark}

[Smells of mincemeat, mint and clove,]{.mark}

[And turkey roasting in the stove;]{.mark}

[A real tree with bells and lights]{.mark}

[Add to the magic of the night.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[Christmas Day, with the gifts unwrapped,]{.mark}

[Snuggled warm on my father's lap;]{.mark}

[The fire is bright, the meal prepared,]{.mark}

[A special time with family shared.]{.mark}

[And in my mind the story plays]{.mark}

[Of why we have this special day;]{.mark}

[Christ came down from Heaven to Earth,]{.mark}

[And so we celebrate His birth.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[Snippets of memories that flash through my mind,]{.mark}

[Scenes from the years which are long left behind.]{.mark}

[With a longing to be in those times again]{.mark}
