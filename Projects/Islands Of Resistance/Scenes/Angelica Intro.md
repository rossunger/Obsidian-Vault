[[Angelica]] beamed as she looked at her gaggle of napping little ones.
Angelica loved kids. She couldn't believe that she was about to have
her own. She'd been dreaming of this since she was 10. Everything in
her life was leading up to this moment. She had studied alternative
education, and for the last 7 years she had been teaching at an
elementary school for "kids with autism". She hated that it was called
that. She had tried explaining to the principle why it was problematic
to talk about autism in such a binary and othering way, but they had had
to agree to disagree.

Angelica had a lot of ideas about how she would raise her kids. She
hoped that [[Angelo]] would be on board with her parenting style, but she
had her doubts. She often wondered what twist of fate had made her fall
in love with such an oaf of a man. They had met in peculiar
circumstances. Angelica had been stood up by a blind date, and was
feeling sorry for herself when Angelo walked in looking for his blind
date, and for some reason when he asked "Mary-lou?" Angelica just
smiled. She wasn't in the habit of lying, but something in the moment
overcame her. She thought she'd probably never see this man again, so
why not? if she wasn't so consumed with self-pity she may have spared a
moment to think of poor Mary-Lou, who would proceed to sit alone for
much of the night, waiting.

It probably wasn't a good idea to start a relationship with a lie, but
Angelica hadn't planned on starting a relationship, it kinda just
happened. She had decided not to date men a few years before, but was
surprised to find that it did not in fact improve her love life, and so
in a moment of low self esteem she gave him her number and one thing led to another and now she's pregnant.

She liked Angelo; he was sweet, kind, and the chemistry was undeniable,
but she didn't know him very well, and she had concerns about what
might lie beneath the surface. He was adamant about keeping his home and work life separate, but some of the things he said made her wonder if he was one of those gender Nazis. That would be such a deal breaker. She
probably should've found that out before deciding to keep the baby, but
she knew deep inside that she could raise the child alone if she had to.
She also still hadn't told him her name wasn't Mary-lou.

Like clockwork, the kids all woke up at once and started running around
and playing. Except [[Xavier]]. He didn't like noise. She brought him his
noise cancelling headphones. He smiled. She had a feeling he would
change the world someday.
