Yeah I've got curves, And I've got cleavage
And I don't want to feel this shame
Yeah I wear clothes, Walk alone at night
And I don't want to feel your blame
Cos it's my body, It's just a body
And I don't want it to be sexed
Not by strangers, friends or family, yeah I demand respect

Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body

Yeah I like Sunshine, And swimming naked
And I can feel your eyes like sharks
And when I'm breastfeeding in public
I can feel your snide remarks
But it's my body, It's MY body
Not for you to criticize
Or admire, or observe, I'm not defined by in your eyes,

Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body

Yeah, the media, and advertising, thrive on sex (cos "sexy sells")
And the products that they're feeding us have frightening parallels
Like my shampoo has got broad shouldered, or it's curvy, "looking good"
In a phallic squeezy bottle that says sexy on the hood
And my bra is working harder to accentuate my breasts
than to help my back and shoulders like its function would suggest
And it's hard to break away from it, it's hard to break the spell
But I wanna live in freedom and I really need your help

Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body

And there's exceptions where I welcome sexual intent,
But I'll tell you if I want that, if I don't \_ then it's non-consent.
And I know it's new and scary, but it sure ain't temporary
Hey, well, buddy, time to step up your game
Maybe now it's time to centre someone else's pain

Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
Un-sex my body
