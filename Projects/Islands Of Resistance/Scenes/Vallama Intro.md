[[Vallama]] managed to remain a pleasant human in most scenarios despite
living with chronic pain for the past decade. They would describe it as
tiny mice slowly eating into their brain. Neither medical bots nor
doctors could find any tangible reason for these symptoms, and
neuro-receptor blockers were out of the question for someone in their
profession, let alone someone with their history of substance abuse.

Vallama was an overseer. Their job was to watch what the artificial
intelligence was doing, and use their human intuition to catch mistakes
before they escalated and became catastrophes. By mid century, machine
learning had become an integral part of most systems, yet in the
majority of cases we still didn't know what happened under the hood.
Even now, the world brightest minds continued to chip away at the
problem to no avail. The algorithms were very good in 99.9% of the
cases, but occasionally the machines learned something funky, and the
only solution we could think of was to have someone sit and watch them
every day, waiting for those moment so that they could swoop in at give
them the proverbial stick of a reset button.
