Stop. Look around the room.
Now lets try it sober.

Hello
My name is *bup ba do da*.
I was wondering if you'd like to talk?
It's okay if you don't really want to.
No? That's okay :) see you round. Have a good one.

It feels funny while you're learning how to talk
But I promise it gets easier with time
Just keep asking and you'll find someone whose
Wishes are aligned with yours and Soon it will be easier
It's worth the time to be a decent human being
Let's respect the pain that other people go through

Stop. Take a few deep breaths
Now let's try this sober
Hey, would you like to dance?
Can you tell I'm a little nervous?
It's okay if you're not really into it,
you can lead if you want? I can leave if you want?
Whatever you say is what will go and I don't want to make you
uncomfortable

It feels funny while you're learning how to talk
But I promise it gets easier with time
Just keep asking and you'll find someone whose
Wishes are aligned with yours and Soon it will be easier
It's worth the time to be a decent human being
Let's respect the pain that other people go through

So you're sitting on your own and you're feeling kinda low
Cos the girl you really liked she turned around and said no

But that's okay, cos you'll move on, and the feeling of rejection will
soon be gone

It feels funny while you're learning how to talk
But I promise it gets easier with time
Just keep asking and you'll find someone whose
Wishes are aligned with yours and Soon it will be easier
It's worth the time to be a decent human being
Let's respect the pain that other people go through
