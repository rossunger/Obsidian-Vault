I was walking to the club when I was suddenly hit
By the speeding train of feminist grit
Labouring hard to make us see
The Basic truths of humanity
The Basic truths of humanity
The Basic truths of humanity

When I got through the door I went straight to the bar\
Everything was normal but I felt bizarre
My brain was going hyper I kept thinking, stop
Why is going out about picking up?
Why is going out about picking up?
Why is going out about picking up?

My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat

And I refuse to be a slave to
Toxic masculinity
Toxic masculinity
Toxic masculinity

I couldn't stop the words from ringing in my ear\
I looked at myself and put down my beer
My staring eyes are like piercing lasers
My wand'ring hands are like piercing razors
My flirty words are like dengue fever
My stalking lust is like a subtle cleaver
And then I heard a whisper, and it grew into a shout
And then I heard a whisper, and it grew into a shout
And then I heard a whisper, and it grew into a shout
And the club spoke up/ And the club spoke up
And the club spoke up/ And the club spoke up

My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat
My friend is not a piece of meat

And I refuse to be a slave to
Toxic masculinity
Toxic masculinity
Toxic masculinity
