Every time you come around here you start talking
Thinking that you know a lot more than I do
How can you be so sure that I am not some kind of
Expert on the subject

There you go again, talking over me
There you go again, mansplaining
You don't have to be an asshole
You don't have to take control
You don't have to know the answer to everything

Why do all discussions end up being a debate
We all have something interesting to say so just wait
Not everyone thinks or talks as fast as you do
And no that doesn't mean that you should try to translate

There you go again, talking over me
There you go again, mansplaining
You don't have to be an asshole
You don't have to take control
You don't have to know the answer to everything

Why don't you just take a seat and let us have a go
Instead of talking over us parading what you know
I know that it's a habit that was one forced onto you
But maybe that's a habit that you're willing to review?

There you go again, talking over me
There you go again, mansplaining
You don't have to be an asshole
You don't have to take control
You don't have to know the answer to everything

Everytime you want to speak just try to hold your breath
And count to 5 and if it's quiet then you can begin
And don't assume you know the truth, try prefacing your thoughts
With "as far as I understand" or something like "I think"
And follow up with questions like "do you have any thoughts?"
And don't dismiss the answers if it's not what you were taught
And sometimes it's ok if you just listen and observe
Cos that's the way to give us space which is what we all deserve
