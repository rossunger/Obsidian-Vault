Give me gorgeous gracious people, let me eat 'em 
Let me suckle on the juices of their inspiration glowing, flowing, boom,
like an ember to a gas can, damn, 
can't get enough of them to keep that fly wheel turning, 
churning crushes into pellets to keep that future fire burning, 
yearning for a world where people flow like chocolate fountains, 
mountains of 'em,
Ripe and ready for the plucking
Intravenous tube to mouth for anytime and carefree sucking,
Fuckin', take me out and treat to some fancy dinners
Gotta feed enough to make it through all these apocalyptic winters

I'm hungry and I gotsta eat, 
it's people feeding time and I want front row seats, 
I'll take a four course meal and doggy bag in case I'm starving later, 
waiter, give me two of everything and a glass of whatever flavour makes the sweet taste linger
I hope you're not offended if I lick my fingers after sticking them in every pie and grator, 
Give my flaming bursting bleeding compliments to  this holy meals creator

I'm firing all cylinders, 
I'm driving and im real immersed 
in conversations unrehearsed, untethered, quenching thirsts I didn't know I had, not bad, 
They're scattered, but you'll sure be glad you took the time to find them, 
not sure why they're always hiding
Like an amazing mansion masquerading as a trash can, 
I say, why, let it Rain, 
I stick my tongue out trynna catch those drops, but man, i feel insane
I'm watching all my fuel form rivers and escape me down a dirty drain, 
I'm Fiending for that friendly fire like an addict seeking crack cocaine
The pillars of my wellness crumbling and forming rough terrain, 
im game for drastic changes, but I can't sustain this constant up and down, quick, breathe! What? Drown, 
 
I'm hungry and I gotsta eat, 
it's people feeding time and I want front row seats, 
I'll take a four course meal and doggy bag in case I'm starving later, 
waiter, give me two of everything and a glass of whatever flavour makes the sweet taste linger
I hope you're not offended if I lick my fingers after sticking them in every pie and grator, 
Give my flaming bursting bleeding compliments to  this holy meals creator
 
I'm literally starving, not sure if I'll make it
Tried that going solo thing, but I just couldn't take it
How do people feed themselves?
Do they just plug their eyes and mouse and nose and eat themselves?
I tried to feast on God but that just made me awful mellow
It's true I learned to love myself some more, but I wasn't well, though, 
And I guess there's cases to be made for winter hibernations
Apocalyptic futures being what they are a solid motivations
We're getting pretty used living in these city isolations
Hey, just mind our souls and bellies don't get premature castrations
  
I'm hungry and I gotsta eat, 
it's people feeding time and I want front row seats, 
I'll take a four course meal and doggy bag in case I'm starving later, 
waiter, give me two of everything and a glass of whatever flavour makes the sweet taste linger
I hope you're not offended if I lick my fingers after sticking them in every pie and grator,
