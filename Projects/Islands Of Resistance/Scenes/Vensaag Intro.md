[[Vensaag]] was a walking dichotomy. They suffered from memory loss that
often made it impossible for them to recall any memories from their
life, however they always knew exactly who they were. Their sense of
identity came from a different kind of memory. A body memory. Their
brain might not retain information in that way, but inside their cells
they carried lifetimes of knowledge.

Vensaag had been part of an experimental program that was exploring the
nature of body memory. Their family had signed them up after they were
diagnosed with a rare degenerative memory condition that had had Vensaag on a highway to vegetable town - a term that most people found
distasteful, offensive even, but Vensaag found cosmically hilarious.
They loved the image of arriving in farm town, and being planted into
the ground next to all the other carrots. Humour is the only thing that
kept them going, in fact. If they had been able to recall the past, they
would have remembered that it was their grandmother that taught them
about humour. She had survived a great many hardships, and would always
say "laughter is the best medicine", and tell stories of how she would
let it loose in the most tragic and traumatic situations, and how it's
the only thing that kept her alive. Vensaag couldn't remember any of
these moments, nor even grandma's face, but in their body, they knew
deeply about the healing power of laughter. It was a gestalt experience.
An intuitive understanding comprised of many factors, without any
ability to pinpoint the specific contributors.

At first it was very uncomfortable for everyone that knew Vensaag. It's
incredible how deeply human interactions are based on memory. People
would stumble every few seconds, trying to relate what they're saying to
a memory, but after a while, people got the hang of it. They found that
Vensaag really was Vensaag, just minus the memories.

It was hard to pinpoint what exactly made them Vensaag. Part of the
experiment had been exploring whether or not humans had a "essence". You can describe a zebra as a 4-legged horse-like creature with stripes, but
it's difficult to explain why taking away a leg doesn't redefine it's
essence, while taking away the stripes does. It's not clear what
Vensaag's stripes are, but to those who knew them before, it was
undeniable that they definitely still have them now.

The irony of their situation is that Vensaag was a public speaker, and
spent their days delivering speeches about the nature of memory. In
another life they had been a literary philosopher and had become
obsessed with the tragic way that memory defines us while being so
utterly unreliable and flawed. Their current relationship with memory
precluded them from having intelligible thoughts about the matter now,
but their fascination with memory hadn't left their body, so the
researchers had suggested Vensaag start delivering pre-written speeches
about the topic, to help them stay connected with the subject, and of
course to help proliferate the findings of the study.
