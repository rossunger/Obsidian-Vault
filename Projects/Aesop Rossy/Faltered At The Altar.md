We faltered at the altar of eternal sin
Within the fascia of our passion lay a fascist fin
caressing carelessly made callouses where what was really needed was a softer skin

Alas we've hardened into wardens who give pardons only to their closest kin
And I would hold you but I'm tortured
And I'm afraid there's nothing left to give

Forgive me for the harshness of the winter cold
That's taken hold of doorways that were previously blessed
I stressed the broken causeways now submerged in subatomic lead

Obsessively I bled till I could bleed no more
In hopes that now devoid of blood I could restrain that old revolving door from playing rake forever stepped on, and thus emancipate my core
But the coroner's report surprisingly says death by suffocation,
It's not the absent blood that brings about the bitter end
Instead the invocation of the final breath without the needed substrate to deliver what the heart had said

But does it take matter how or why what we once loved is dead?
We say farewell and thank You as we bow our humble heads
