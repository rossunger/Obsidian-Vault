![[Summary]]

Your writing should be set in the same universe as this novel. Here are things you should know about this universe:

-   It's our universe, but set in the future, probably the middle of the 22nd century
    
-   The government has distorted or destroyed most of the history records, so people either don't know what happened in our time, or have a ridiculously wrong idea about it. Sometimes you can find illegal books that tell the truth, but without context they can seem like nonsense.
    
-   The Sun in our atmosphere has become dangerous and exposure to direct sunlight is fatal for most people.
    
-   Most People live in “the city”, which is full of skyscrapers, and is entirely enclosed in a glass-like substance that filters the sunlight to be good for humans again. Outside the city are refugee camps, with people barely surviving, waiting to be let into the city which is “at capacity”
    
-   The city was built as a solution to a climate crisis, and the design was led by 4 brilliant individuals who had a utopian vision for the future. However, their descendants corrupted this vision, and now the wealthy control the sunlight. Folks with money live at the top of buildings and get as much sunlight as they want, while the poor live at the bottom and don’t get any sun.
    
-   There is an elevator system that allows folks to go up and down, but it is illegal to go to higher floors without a permit, and the elevator scans your eyes to identify you before you can enter.
    
-   There have been numerous technological advances, all of which are trademarked secrets and intellectual property of the wealthy:
    

-   “Sun patches”, kinda like nicotine patches, can replace a person's daily Sun intake, however they are not cheap. The middle class can afford them, but folks at the bottom levels can't. These patches can replace food also, as they provide energy to your body.
    
-   “The circuitry” is a  brain implant that allows the controller to zap you, and is used as a form of control, or torture. Mostly used by police, or very controlling parents.
    
-   Solar panels are made from chlorophyll and function like plants. These are what power the city. Nobody knows this, but these Solar panels are actual humans who have been injected with chlorophyll… the government has been using prisoners to power the city.
    
-   The radicals sometimes use amnesia pills in case they get interrogated which make them forget what they've done.
    

-   In the last 30 years the government started the gender police and has been waging a war on gender nonconformity. The current ruler, King of Q, started it for political reasons, but is now thinking of ending it because their adult son is queer, and it has served it’s political purpose. 
    
-   Their son, Prince of Q, has been running a kind of queer Mafia, getting away with anything because of their father's protection. They are an anonymous patron of the Quinn, an infamous underground queer bar in the lower levels.
    
-   There are at least 2 sets of revolutionaries: the friendly neighborhood revolutionaries, and the Agents of changes, the latter being radicals who aren't afraid to be violent
    
-   Within the city, there are folks who hate the city and are planning a way to escape and build their own city. They just need to steal all the secrets of the technology.
