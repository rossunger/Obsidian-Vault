[**Rum:** Hmm. It all started last Oktoberfest. I was making last minute
preparations for the Great Oktoberfest Commission -- the most

this year.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** We stand here, to remember the poor souls who perished in
the great Oktoberfest disaster a month ago today. It is a sad day for
our great city - A day where beer has conquered reason. A day where man
has become slave to the vile menace that is alcohol.]{.mark}

[**Woman:** Think of the children!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** It time for us to open our eyes and see - how many more
must die before we put an end to this madness? If I am elected today, I
will call for a ban on the production and sale of alcohol; A prohibition
in memory of all those we lost on the dark day.]{.mark}

[**Radio:** And in breaking news, the controversy surrounding the Great
Oktoberfest disaster has won Jeffrey Anderson the mayoral election. The
newly inducted Mayor Anderson has already begun coming true on his
promise to make our city a dry state. Many public health and safety
groups have praised this decision saying it will bring down the crime
rate, while in other parts of town, violent riots have began. We suggest
you stay indoors and avoid the streets until things settle down.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** It wasn't your fault. You can't blame yourself.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Hmmm. Hey Raisin, do you reckon I could stay with you for a
bit? I just realised I]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Gee. Normally I\'d say no problem, but I kinda live in this
ice-cream truck]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You what?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, in the back. It\'s actually quite spacious. It\'s
more like an ice-cream trailer.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Hahaha. But seriously, Raisin, can I stay with you?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Well, I guess; I\'ll have to move some things around; I can
probably squeeze you in between the cooling racks and the ventilation
shaft]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Wait, you actually live here?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah. I can\'t really afford anything else right now. The
truck hasn\'t exactly been a success.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Don\'t you worry, no one\'s gonna go to prison]{.mark}

[getting caught -- it really isn\'t]{.mark}

[part of my great plan]{.mark}

[instead we\'ll take the van]{.mark}

[and ride from to town to town]{.mark}

[no-one will ever find us]{.mark}

[always one step behind us]{.mark}

[Ice-cream is the perfect cover]{.mark}

[and I think you\'ll soon discover]{.mark}

[With my skills and your finesse]{.mark}

[Our business is a sure success]{.mark}

[So what\'s the problem?]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Oh, I don\'t know--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Are you man or are you mouse?]{.mark}

[Don\'t be so pusillanimous]{.mark}

[We\'ll think of something]{.mark}

[between my wit \'n\' your innocence]{.mark}

[Our business is a sure success]{.mark}

[A first class act]{.mark}

[Brother take my hand]{.mark}

[It\'s time to make a stand]{.mark}

[This truck was going nowhere]{.mark}

[But now we both can go where]{.mark}

[The nights are always sunny,\
And the booze means we\'ll make money]{.mark}

[The ice-cream\'s are all pretty and]{.mark}

[Soon we\'ll own this city]{.mark}

[We\'ll be the greatest duo in the land]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I just don\'t feel comfortable selling booze, let alone
illegally]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Comfortable? How do you think I feel?]{.mark}

[I\'ve got no house]{.mark}

[I\'ve got no car]{.mark}

[I\'ve got no job]{.mark}

[And I\'ve got no bar]{.mark}

[And the police, they drive me schizo]{.mark}

[And prohibition it just, it\'s so]{.mark}

[limiting, it\'s limiting, it\'s killing my dream]{.mark}

[But I won\'t let that stop me!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I said no. I don\'t want to do anything illegal. I\'d
rather just go back to working at Manny\'s.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You\'re never gonna get into the ice-cream academy if you
don\'t take any risks. You can\'t just sit around and wait for
everything to work itself out.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But Dad said -]{.mark}

[**Rum:** It doesn\'t matter what Dad said. You can keep applying for
the rest of your life if you like, but I\'m sick of having to pick up
the pieces every time you don\'t get it.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[*Raisin storms out.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin! Raisin I shouldn\'t have said that.]{.mark}

[*Cutaway to Raisin.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I remember when daddy left on his final journey]{.mark}

[It was almost like he knew he wasn\'t coming back]{.mark}

[He took my hand so I\'d understand that he was serious]{.mark}

[He whispered \"Don\'t give up on dreams, cos dreams come true\"]{.mark}

[And ever since that day I\'ve known that everything I ever want to do
will work out]{.mark}

[and though I know that\
It\'s still hard to follow through]{.mark}

[Every time I start anew, but]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[**Raisin/Rum:** Copenhagen\'s calling / Brother take my hand]{.mark}

[The city of ice-cream / It\'s time to make a stand]{.mark}

[Copenhagen\'s calling / This truck was going nowhere]{.mark}

[The academy of dreams / But now we both can go where]{.mark}

[I\'m waiting for the letter / The nights are always sunny,]{.mark}

[I\'m waiting for the call / And the booze means we\'ll make
money]{.mark}

[Copenhagen / The ice-cream\'s pretty and]{.mark}

[I\'m coming home / Soon we\'ll own this city]{.mark}

[*They exchange an understanding look, acknowledging that Raisin has
decided to go partners with Rum, and that they both apologise for
fighting*]{.mark}

[**Goon 2:** Ice cream? You two better come with us]{.mark}

*[Rum and Raisin get thrown down before the Don]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Hey!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Ow.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Why hello boys.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Who are you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** A friend]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Is that you Carl?]{.mark}

[*Don looks at his henchmen*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Who\'s Carl?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** What do you want with us?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I just wanted to give you a friendly warning from a fellow
businessman. This line of work you\'re getting into - can be rather
dangerous. I wouldn\'t want to see two fine young boys like yourself
getting hurt.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Is that a threat?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Did Carl put you up to this?]{.mark}

[**Don:** No. Who is Carl?!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Are you sure?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Do you know who I am?!]{.mark}

*[Rum and Raisin shrug]{.mark}*

[**Don:** I am the great Don Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Sorry, who?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Don Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Fettuccine? like the pasta?]{.mark}

[**Don:** No! The pasta is like me.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Long and flat?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the boss of the most feared organisation in this city and
you two are stepping on my toes. I control all the racketeering business
in this town, so if you want to continue with your little truck on my
turf--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, we\'re just selling
ice cream.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** And don\'t forget the-]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Cones.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, and the-]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Toppings.]{.mark}

[\
**Raisin:** Yeah and-]{.mark}

*[Rum stamps on Raisin\'s foot.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Do you think I\'m an idiot? I own this city. And if you two
clowns aren\'t careful I\'ll own you too.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We\'re not afraid of you]{.mark}

[**Don:** Mmm. But you will be. Let me tell you a story]{.mark}

[**Goons:** da don don don don.]{.mark}

[**Don:** A while back I had to go to the store]{.mark}

[I drove around the parking lot for an hour of more]{.mark}

[Finally I see a spot, my indicator\'s on]{.mark}

[But little granny dares to swerve in front of the Don]{.mark}

[she steps out of her car and I\'m like:]{.mark}

[\"Lady, do you know who I am? I\'m the Don!\"]{.mark}

[**lady:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the DON]{.mark}

[**lady:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m THE DON]{.mark}

[**lady:** What\'s a Don? As in the salami?]{.mark}

[**Don:** GAH!!!]{.mark}

[**Don:** She should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[She\'s gonna regret crossing Fettuccine]{.mark}

[I put her cat up in a tree]{.mark}

[I threw her fish back in the sea]{.mark}

[I buried her earthworms in the ground]{.mark}

[I took the collar off her hound.]{.mark}

[She should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[She won\'t forget the name: Don Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That\'s just inconvenient.]{.mark}

[**Don:** You\'re damn right it is! You know what else is
inconvenient]{.mark}

[I was going to the store to return a faulty broom]{.mark}

[No matter how I asked it to it wouldn\'t sweep my room]{.mark}

[I went up to the counter and I spoke to a greasy teen]{.mark}

[I said \"I\'d like another broom please - this one just won\'t
clean\"]{.mark}

[**Teen:** I\'m sorry sir, you can\'t return a broom.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Do you know who I am?!]{.mark}

[*Teen looks at him blankly*]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the Don!]{.mark}

[**Teen:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the DON]{.mark}

[**Teen:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m THE DON]{.mark}

[**Teen:** As in the salami? I\'m vegetarian\....]{.mark}

[**Don:** GAH!!!]{.mark}

[**Don:** He should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[He\'s gonna regret crossing Fettuccine]{.mark}

[I swapped his acne cream for grease]{.mark}

[I gave his name to the police]{.mark}

[I threw his scooter down a hill]{.mark}

[I stole his stupid best friend Phil]{.mark}

[**Phil:** Hello.]{.mark}

[*Pause. Everyone looks at Phil.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** He should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[He won\'t forget the name: Don Fettuccine]{.mark}

**[Rum &]{.mark}**

[**Raisin:** Can we go now?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m not finished.]{.mark}

[I was waiting for the elevator to get back to my car]{.mark}

[When suddenly a swarm of kids came running here from near and
far]{.mark}

[The lift rolled down they all piled on]{.mark}

[And there was no room left for the Don]{.mark}

[Do you know who I am?]{.mark}

[**Kid:** No?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the Don!]{.mark}

[**Kid:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m THE DON!]{.mark}

[**Kid:** You\'re the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'M THE DON!]{.mark}

[**Kid:** Is good?]{.mark}

[**Don:** GAH!!!]{.mark}

[They should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[They\'re gonna regret crossing Fettuccine]{.mark}

[I got them all banned from the pool]{.mark}

[I drew in all their books at school]{.mark}

[I made sure all of their juices would leak]{.mark}

[I stole their lunches for a week]{.mark}

[: They should\'a known better than to mess with me]{.mark}

[They won\'t forget the name: Don Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But they\'re just kids!]{.mark}

[**Don:** So here\'s a warning - this one\'s for free]{.mark}

[You\'re gonna regret it if you mess with me]{.mark}

[I\'ll mix up all your ice-cream labels]{.mark}

[I\'ll pull out all your power cables]{.mark}

[I\'ll whip the foam from off your spiders]{.mark}

[Shove my apples in your cider]{.mark}

[Put a leak in all your beer taps]{.mark}

[Rip the stickers off your schnapps]{.mark}

[Replace you ice-cream scoops with tweezers]{.mark}

[Put my meat pie in your freezer]{.mark}

[Fill your sinks up with my\...]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Who does this guy think he is?]{.mark}

[**Don:** WEREN\'T YOU LISTENING TO THE SONG?!]{.mark}

[**Goons:** Fettuccine, Fettuccine, Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Don:** Last warning. Drop the booze, or I\'ll drop you]{.mark}

[*Exit the Don and his goons.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Who was that guy?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I don\'t think that was Carl.]{.mark}

**[SCENE 9]{.mark}**

[*The band plays a short reprise of the Don song. Rum and Raising return
to their truck to find*]{.mark}

*[it clamped. Raisin runs to it, and tries to pull it off.]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** What is this thing? It won\'t come off. It\'s like this
metal bar just glued itself to our car]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That\'s no ordinary metal bar, Raisin. That\'s a police grade
clamp]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But we didn\'t do anything wrong; the sign says 4 hour
parking, and we\'ve only been here 15 minutes.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I don\'t think it was the police, Raisin.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You don\'t think -- The Don?]{.mark}

[**Chorus:** Fettuccine Fettuccine Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Rum:** It\'s just so mildly inconvenient; who else would do such a
thing?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Rum, I\'m scared. Think of what else this man could do;
today it\'s clamps, tomorrow, bullet holes, next thing we know he\'ll be
setting our truck on fire and we\'ll go to jail for insurance
fraud!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin --]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I mean, you\'re a convicted felon! It\'s on your permanent
record! Who\'s gonna]{.mark}

> [believe you?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin --]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** And me -- I\'ll never get into the ice-cream academy; I
can\'t afford to have a criminal record --]{.mark}

[**Rum:** PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER! We\'re not going to jail. All we know
so far is that this guy likes to cause mild inconveniences to people who
cross his path. As far as we know, he\'s never even killed anyone. I
mean, what kind of Mafioso is so obscure that his name has NEVER been
printed in the papers? I mean --]{.mark}

*[Rum asks a random passer by]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Have you heard of the Don?]{.mark}

[**Random:** The who?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** The Don?]{.mark}

[**Random:** The who?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** The Don!]{.mark}

[**Random:** As in the Salami?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** *(to Raisin)* See? And are you really gonna give up on your
dreams so easily? Aren\'t you prepared to risk everything for a chance
meet Hindenhagendagenbagen--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** --bergen]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Whatever. We are so close to success. All we gotta do is take
off this clamp, forget that swill we would\'ve got at the docks. You\'ve
got everything we need for me to whip up a batch of the finest sink wine
you would ever need. and go for a drive. So are you with me?]{.mark}

*[Raisin hesitates.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Partner?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** oh alright. Let\'s do it!]{.mark}

*[Rum and Raisin try to pull off the clamp, but fail.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Wow. This is harder than it looks.]{.mark}

*[Enter Rachel. She looks on as the brothers continue to
struggle.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** Do you guys need a hand?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Nope. We\'re fine. We\'ve got this.]{.mark}

*[They continue struggling.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** Seriously, do you need a hand?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin, this isn\'t gonna budge]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Guys, I know how to get that off I used to work as-]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We need to get some bolt cutters]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You know I think I have some in my car-]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We could just call the police, surely they could just take
it off.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Guys!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** What?]{.mark}

[*Rachel leans down and pulls the clamp. It comes off easily.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What? How did you do that?]{.mark}

[**Rachel :** Oh I\'ve had my car clamped more then a few times.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Thank you]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m Rachel. Rachel Linguine.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You look really familiar]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I\'m Raisin, and that\'s Rum.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Rum and Raisin? like the ice-cream?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** No, the ice-cream is like us.]{.mark}

[*Rachel is confused. Rum eyes her off suspiciously*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Don't I know you?]{.mark}

[**Raisin*: ***Say, would you like an ice-cream? For your
troubles?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Sure, that\'d be great]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Whatever.]{.mark}

making her an ice-]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** So, how\'s the business going? I\'ve heard the ice-cream
market collapsed.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Honestly, I don\'t know. I just handle the ice-cream. Rum
worries about that stuff. What topping would you like?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Um, strawberry. So Rum does all the "Legal" stuff? The
books, the permits, the supplies?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, I was never very good at all that. I was always the
"artist" in the family.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Oh, you guys are related?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** He\'s my brother. He\'s always looked out for me.]{.mark}

[\
**Rachel:** So, you could say this is a family business?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, I guess so. Rum\'s the one who gave me the money to
get this truck in the first place. He even went to jail for it.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** That\'s so nice of him\...wait what?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Jail. Its a place bad people go. But sometimes good people
get sent there by accident]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I know what you mean\...I see it all the time--]{.mark}

*[Rachel\'s phone goes off..]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** You see it all the time?]{.mark}

*[Rachel looks at her wrist with no watch on it.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** It\'s my boss. Oh god, look at the time. I gotta
run.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Ok. Bye!]{.mark}

*[Rachel exits]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** What was her problem?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** She was really lovely. We had a nice chat about
prison]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Prison? What, is she a cop or something?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What? No way!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Whatever, I\'ve got everything set up. let\'s roll.]{.mark}

said you were going to stop this before it got out.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m sorry. I\'m working on it but I don\'t have-]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, I ran into her just now. Literally.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Are you alright?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** She was just telling me about how she lost her job]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Oh yeah? What line of work were you in?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Oh, you know, the driving, portable hospitality
kind]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Oh yeah? Which one?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Breadknobs and Breadsticks]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Hmm. Never heard of it.]{.mark}

[**Raisin** I love bread!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yeah, it was really great. I really enjoy the
industry.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Me too. We have so much in common.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That\'s nice. Anyway we better get back to work.]{.mark}

[**Rachel** : I just wish I could find another job like that.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\'m sure you will.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I can help you look for another if you want?]{.mark}

[**Rachel** : But they\'re so hard to find these days, nobody sells food
out of vans any more.]{.mark}

[*Awkward silence*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** So, are you guys hiring?--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** not really--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yes! We were just saying, weren\'t we Rum, that we could
use an extra pair of hands around the\...the\...]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yes. That\'s what I call the soft-serve dispenser]{.mark}

never shown any interest]{.mark}

partner for a minute.]{.mark}

[*Pulls him aside.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Have you lost it? We can\'t afford to pay her. And what if she
finds out about the you know what- (does a booze hand gesture)
--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But -]{.mark}

[**Rum:** She can\'t stay. What if she finds out? What if she\'s a
cop?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** She\'s not a cop!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** How do you know? Have you asked her?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You can\'t just go around accusing people of being a cop!
You have to trust people--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Not when you running an large-scale bootlegging
operation!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I wouldn\'t call our sink large scale. And you\'re the one
running a bootlegging operation, I\'m just selling ice-cream]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We\'re in this together Raisin. She\'s out of the question.
You have to tell her that we --]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** If it wasn\'t for her, the truck would still have that
clamp on it.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Just cause she helped us out once doesn\'t mean-]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** This is our chance to return the favour.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Its too risky]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Dad always said that if someone does a good turn for you,
you have to pay it back. She can just drive the truck or something. She
won\'t go anywhere near the booze.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\....I--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Rum, come on. What would dad say?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Oh alright. But its on your head.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Really?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** And she\'s to stay away from the sink! Go, before I change my
mind.]{.mark}

trial.]{.mark}

him]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** He\'s just sizing you up. Hey, you\'re not a cop, are
you?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** uh--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Great! I didn\'t think so. It\'s just that he\'s a had it
pretty tough, ended up in some stupid situation that really weren\'t his
fault; had a couple of run-ins with a law; he kinda finds it hard to
trust people; I don\'t wanna see him get hurt again. It\'s like ever
since dad died-- he won\'t even talk about it. But don\'t worry about
him. He\'s just]{.mark}

[All of the lying]{.mark}

[Misguidedly trying]{.mark}

[To save you the pain]{.mark}

[For though he was fam\'ly]{.mark}

[Dad wasn\'t fam\'ly]{.mark}

[Fam\'ly doesn\'t give up]{.mark}

[You were only a child]{.mark}

[Who was I to tell you then it was all a lie]{.mark}

[That dad didn\'t really die]{.mark}

**[SCENE 12]{.mark}**

[*Ice-cream truck. Raisin gives Rachel a tour.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Soooo. This is the truck. This is the ice-cream. This is
the freezer. This is the-- don\'t worry about that]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Great. So what do you want me to do?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Well, you\'ve worked in trucks before, why don\'t you start
with the --]{.mark}

[**Rum:** The ice-cream stick?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Uh, no, that\'s for later. How about we check on the ice
cream?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'ve had some of your ice cream before. Its really good.
Where do you get it from?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Get it from? I make it.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Really?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Right here in this truck. We make everything here
ourselves.]{.mark}

[**Rachel :** Everything?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Come on, I\'ll show you!]{.mark}

[*Cutaway. Don tries on different disguises.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Disguises disguises. Lets see, mechanic? To obvious. Police
officer? No, there\'s no way they\'d ever trust a police officer. They
need to have sympathy for my character. Little orphan boy? Poor lost
southern belle. Maybe\...]{.mark}

[*Goon 1 (Phil) enters*]{.mark}

[**Don:** (as southern belle) well excuse me you two fine gentlemen, but
would either of you spare a glass of cool lemonade for a-]{.mark}

[**Phil:** Excuse me sir.]{.mark}

[**Don:** What? What is it?]{.mark}

[**Phil:** The Castelucci Brothers. We found them.]{.mark}

[*Raisin teaches Rachel the art of making ice-cream. Rum observes from a
distance*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Think of it like a canvas, and your mind is the
brush]{.mark}

*[Song]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** First you melt the butter down]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Like this?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Like that]{.mark}

[Then you let the custard brown]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Like this?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Like that]{.mark}

[Then you spread the cream around and round.]{.mark}

*[Dance number. Rum observes them.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** She really cares for him]{.mark}

[She really cares]{.mark}

[Why did I doubt her\
We\'d be nowhere without her]{.mark}

[Now I know, that\
She really cares]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[*End song.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** That\'s it! You\'ve got it. You\'re doing really well. I\'m
gonna go start up the old ice cream stick. While I\'m gone, maybe you
could help me fill out this food and truck registration form?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Food and truck?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah, they\'re the authority on all things food and truck
related.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Strange, I\'ve never heard of them]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Me neither, but they sent me this pretty legal looking
documents, and I don\'t really understand what they\'re about, you know,
the government, they just do whatever they want nowadays]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Riiiiiight. How about I read over this and get back to
you?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Great!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** (whispers to rum) I told you she\'d be good for
something!]{.mark}

[*Rum smirks*. *Exit Raisin. Rachel sees Rum watching.*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What is it?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Rachel, I\'m sorry.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\...I\'ve been really unfair to you. And I can see that now.
I owe you an apology.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You haven\'t done anything wrong.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** When we first met you, I didn\'t trust you at all. I said
things behind your back. I called you a liar, I even accused you of
being a cop! But watching you with Raisin just now, I can see that I was
wrong to mistrust you; I just--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Rum--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I can tell you really care about Raisin, so I just want you to
know that I no longer have any doubts or reservations about you. I know
you wouldn\'t do anything to hurt him.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You really care about your brother don\'t you? Its great
how much you look out for him.]{.mark}

[\
**Rum:** Well I\'ve had to, ever since dad left us\...\
]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** It must be hard losing a parent. How did he die
again?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** He didn\'t. He walked out on us. Packed his bags and
left]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** But Raisin said--\
\
*Rachel realises*\
\
He doesn\'t know, does he?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\'ve been meaning to tell him; I just can\'t bring myself to
do it. He thinks the world of dad. It\'d break his heart]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You\'ll have to tell him eventually. You can\'t keep lying
forever, and the longer you keep this up, the more it\'s gonna hurt when
it all comes out.\
]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I know. I just\...he\'s my baby brother]{.mark}

[\
**Rachel:** He\'s stronger than you think. He can handle it.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You reckon?\
\
**Rachel:** I\'m sure of it.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You\'re probably right]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I better go read these forms.]{.mark}

[\
*Rum is distracted thinking about Raisin*\
]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Yeah\...]{.mark}

*[Rachel goes out back.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Little brother]{.mark}

[Growing up so fast]{.mark}

[Living all his dreams at last]{.mark}

[Its time]{.mark}

[\
Soon he won\'t need me]{.mark}

[Soon he\'ll exceed me]{.mark}

[Its time.]{.mark}

[\
Its time to tell him]{.mark}

[He\'s ready to know]{.mark}

[What I should\'ve told him]{.mark}

[So long ago]{.mark}

[It\'s time]{.mark}

[It\'s time]{.mark}

*[Rum is interrupted by the Don, who enters disguised as Gareth, a
safety inspector.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Hello? Excuse me? Mr Castelucci?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Yes? Can I help you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** My name is Gareth Keenly, and I\'m with the food and truck
administration. I\'m here to carry out a routine food safety
check]{.mark}

[**Rum:** How did you find us?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Uhh, GPS?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Sounds legit]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m going to have to take a look around the truck, and make
sure everything meets the standards issued under the Food And Truck
Hygiene Act of 1979.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Uh, sorry, the what?]{.mark}

[**Don:** The Food and Truck Hygiene Act of 1979.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\'ve never heard of it.]{.mark}

[**Don:** You\'ve never heard of it? Tut tut tut.]{.mark}

[*Gareth takes a note on his clipboard.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Oh, you mean THE Food and Truck Hygiene Act, with the food,
and the trucks. I remember that one.]{.mark}

[*Raisin re-enters*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Who are you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m Gareth with the food and truck administration, just
running a routine inspection in compliance with Food and Truck Hygiene
Act of 1979]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** The what?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** The Food and Truck Hygiene Act, you know, of 1979]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Oh! You mean the Food and Truck Hygiene ACT, of 1979. I
thought you said 1879, and I was just thinking, they didn\'t have trucks
back then]{.mark}

[**Don:** Riiiiight. If you don\'t mind I\'ll start my
inspection]{.mark}

[**Chorus:** Da don don don don]{.mark}

[*As Gareth sings, he trashes the truck: puts dirt on the counter,
adjusts the thermometer, etc. while searching for the booze.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** So, your counter\'s rather dirty]{.mark}

[What\'s the temperature, like, thirty?]{.mark}

[Where are all your ice-cream labels?]{.mark}

[These are faulty power cables]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[Your cones are cracked]{.mark}

[These things aren\'t stacked]{.mark}

[Tell me that\'s not an open packet!]{.mark}

[Your shelves are full of baby spiders]{.mark}

[Where are your flavour dividers]{.mark}

[Why no ice-cream scoops just tweezers?]{.mark}

[There\'s a meat pie in your freezer]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Hold on, that sounds familiar]{.mark}

[*Enter Rachel.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Clearly this business isn\'t fit to food and truck in public.
I\'m gonna have to ask you two to-- Who are you]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m Rachel Linguine, I work here. Who are you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the Do-- I mean, I\'m Gareth Keenley, I\'m with the food
and truck administration. I\'m here to carry out a routine food safety
check]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Remember? The Food and Truck Hygiene Act of 1979]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I thought you\'d know that, having worked in trucks
before?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Riiiiight. That\'s not a real thing. Can I see some
identification please?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Uh, sure. It\'s right here]{.mark}

*[Gareth pulls out his wallet, and throws it at her. He then
runs.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Well that was odd.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I don\'t think that was a real inspector]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** No, it most certainly wasn\'t. The food and truck
administration? I mean come on!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** That\'s not real either?! Then who\'s been sending me all
those food and truck registration bills?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Well done Rachel!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Thank you so much!]{.mark}

[*Raisin sees some ice-cream that Rachel has made.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Oh my god! You\'re amazing!]{.mark}

[*Raisin heads over to the ice-cream*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Oh it was nothing]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Gareth Keenly, that doesn\'t even sound like a real
name.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Look at this chocolate ripple! Its amazing!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** The ice cream?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** It\'s great. You\'re a natural.]{.mark}

*[Raisin tastes the ice-cream. It tastes awful.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** I think I got the sugar to salt ratio all wrong.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Its\...not awful\...show me what you did]{.mark}

*[Cutaway. Don picks up his ice-cream trucks.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Are they ready?]{.mark}

[**Mechanic:** Sir, I told you I needed more time. By my aunt\'s haggis
these things, they ain\'t]{.mark}

> [stable.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Will they run?]{.mark}

[**Me.chanic:** Yes sir but-]{.mark}

[**Don:** Then they\'re ready. Its time to paint this town
Fettuccine]{.mark}

[**Mechanic:** How can ye paint the town with pasta?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Nevermind.]{.mark}

*[The sound of evil ice cream trucks revving signalling Rum and
Raisin\'s doom. Cut back.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** First I melt the butter down]{.mark}

[(instrument plays the "like this?" melody)]{.mark}

[Like that]{.mark}

[Then I let the custard brown]{.mark}

[(instrument plays the "like this?" melody)]{.mark}

[Like that]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[Then I spread the cream around and round]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[*Dance number.*]{.mark}

**[Rachel:]{.mark}** I really care for them

I really care

[What is this feeling]{.mark}

[That I\'ve been concealing]{.mark}

[Could it be that I really care]{.mark}

*[End song.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Hey Raisin, I think we should tell her]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You don\'t mean the-- Really? but I thought--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** She\'s earned it.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What are you talking about?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Sometimes you just have to trust people.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What\'s going on?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You know how this is an ice-cream truck?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yeah?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Well, its not just an ice-cream truck.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We\'re selling grandmas milk.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You\'re selling what?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Something something monkeys.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Monkeys?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We\'re putting them back on the wagon.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Um\...]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** The public\'s got a date--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We\'re selling booze.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Oh.]{.mark}

[Wow.]{.mark}

[That\'s illegal.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** There are lots of ridiculous laws, they come and go. It\'s
only a matter of time before the prohibition fad dries up.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yeah, but--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Until then, we\'re just providing a public service.]{.mark}

[*Rachel is unconvinced*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Look, I\'m just a guy with a dream; a dream that means more to
me than anything, and I\'m not gonna let some stupid law stop me.
Alcohol is my life. I study it, I make it, I live and breathe it. When
prohibition came in, a part of me died. The best part. But I brought it
back to life, and I don\'t want it to die again. So I\'m asking you to
help me fight for my right to be me. Can you do that?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Can I have a minute to think about all this?]{.mark}

*[Rachel moves aside to think. She readies herself to call
Anderson.]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** What do you think she\'ll do]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I don\'t know, Raisin. I don\'t know]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I think she\'ll stay.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I hope so.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I bet dad would have really like her.]{.mark}

[*Little brother theme plays and reminds Rum of what he needs to
do*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I\'ve been thinking, with the whole alcohol and ice cream
thing, wouldn\'t it be great if we thought about started to expand into
a more--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin\...there\'s something I need to tell you.]{.mark}

*[Meanwhile Rachel, holding a bottle of rum in her hand, calls
Anderson.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** Anderson, there\'s something I need to tell you-]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** About time you called. You\'re overdue for a report. I
need to know if these are the bootleggers we\'re looking for.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I-]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Because they\'re gonna pay for what they did. We can\'t
just let criminals wreak havoc on our streets! We need to punish them.
Put them behind bars. Show them that we have no love for the likes of
them. When I get my hands on them I\'m gonna-]{.mark}

*[Anderson fades into the background. Rachel sings.]{.mark}*

**Rachel:** ~~What am I doing? I can\'t tell him the truth.~~

~~I know what it\'s like to be a misguided youth~~

~~He\'ll tear them to shreds, show no signs of remiss~~

~~They\'ve broken the law, but they don\'t deserve this~~

~~Gah\...I\'m just doing my job, it\'s not my place to decide~~

~~They\'ve broken the law, they deserve to be tried~~

~~But they\'re not like the others, they\'re so sweet and so nice~~

~~Gah. What do I do? I need some advice\...~~

~~Should I tell him?~~

~~I\'m gonna tell him\...~~

[*Rachel zones in to Anderson speaking*]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Rachel? Rachel?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yes?]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** You weren\'t you paying attention, were you. What\'s
going on? Have you found any evidence or not?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Not yet. Still looking. But I\'m close. Very close.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** It\'s ok. We\'ll get \'em soon. It\'s only a matter of
time.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yeah\...]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Those boys\'ll be doing time in no time. I\'ll see you
back at the office]{.mark}

*[Anderson hangs up.]{.mark}*

**Rachel:** No! Why didn\'t I tell him?!

[Why do I have turn on the people I love]{.mark}

[When all they do is love me and give me the trust that I never
deserve]{.mark}

[*Rachel looks at Rum and Raisin.*]{.mark}

[When all they do is love me,]{.mark}

[And all I do is lie]{.mark}

*Rachel exits. "Home" theme plays. []{.mark}*

**[Scene 13]{.mark}**

*[Outside the truck. Rum and Raisin as Rachel approaches them to
confess.]{.mark}*

[**Rachel:** Guys I -]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What are you saying?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** He wasn\'t actually an explorer. He was an alcoholic, and a
bum. He wasn\'t chasing his dream. Dad just left us. He abandoned
us.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But you told me--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I lied! I\'m sorry. You were too young. I, I just- I thought
it would be for the best.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But what about the electric ice-cream maker he sent
me?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That was me. I sent you the electric ice-cream maker]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** That was\...you?\...?\...I--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I bought it for you cos I could see how much you loved making
ice- cream]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What about all the letters?]{.mark}

*[Rum smiles apologetically.]{.mark}*

[**Raisin:** That was you too?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** I\'m so sorry.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** How could you do this? You\'ve been lying to me this whole
time?!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin please -]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** How can I trust you after this? I let you take my truck and
turn it into this!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You have to forgive me. Please.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I\....I don\'t. I have to-]{.mark}

*[Raisin runs off. Rum starts to follow him, but changes his
mind.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Raisin! Raisin come back! Don\'t\....]{.mark}

(to Rachel) Yep. He can definitely handle it.

[**Rachel:** I--]{.mark}

[*Pause.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You should go.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** You should go home. I don\'t think we\'re going to make any
more sales today.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\...ok. I\'ll see you tomorrow?]{.mark}

[*Rum shrugs his shoulders, gets in the van and drives off.*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Right.]{.mark}

*[A fleet of ice-cream trucks swarm the stage. The Don enters upon an
ice cream chariot.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Where is everyone?]{.mark}

[Hey you.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Me?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Yeah. Where are the Castalluci brothers?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** They\'ve gone. Can I help you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Who are you?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m Rachel. Who are you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the-- Nevermind, you won\'t remember me anyway.]{.mark}

[Hmm\...]{.mark}

[Well\...I had this whole spiel prepared\...but\...I guess\...can I
leave a message?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Sure.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Tell them "I\'m very disappointed in them" and that they\'ve
"made a big mistake" and "there\'s gonna be trouble." Yeah, say that.
"there\'s gonna be trouble." Now that I\'ve got my fleet of ice-cream
trailers, I\'d like to see them try selling their booze. You can tell
the boys there\'s a new don in town.]{.mark}

[**Chorus:** Fettuccine Fettuccine Fettuccine]{.mark}

**[ACT 2]{.mark}**

**[SCENE 1]{.mark}**

[*Street performers (a mariachi band) sing the Ballad of Rum and Raisin.
Montage of the Don fuming when people think his trucks belong to rum and
raisin*]{.mark}

[**Chorus:** The brothers Rum and Raisin]{.mark}

[They ride from town to town]{.mark}

[And everyone who knows them thinks they\'re crazy]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[For they be selling liquor]{.mark}

[In the driest state on Earth]{.mark}

[And not even the Mafia can stop them]{.mark}

[**\
**The brothers Castelucci are riding on the winds of change]{.mark}

[Now Rum he had a bar]{.mark}

[He burnt it to the ground]{.mark}

[And Raisin he was pretty much a no-one]{.mark}

[Now they ride from town to town]{.mark}

[Selling liquor to the land]{.mark}

[And everyone who knows them here is grateful]{.mark}

[The brothers Castelucci are riding on the winds of change]{.mark}

[The ice-cream trade was failing]{.mark}

[And the booze was running dry]{.mark}

[But now they have a fleet of ice-cream trailers]{.mark}

[Now they ride from town to town]{.mark}

[Selling liquor to the land]{.mark}

[And everyone who knows them here is grateful]{.mark}

[The brothers oh the brothers]{.mark}

[The brothers oh the brothers]{.mark}

[The brothers Castelucci are riding on the winds of change]{.mark}

**[SCENE 2]{.mark}**

[*Police HQ. The Mariachi band stands before Rachel and
Anderson.*]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** (to the band) get out of my sight]{.mark}

[ I thought you said they had nothing to do with this? How could you not
know about this? A mariachi band knew about this and you -- Do you have
any idea how incompetent you make me look?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You\'re after the wrong guys.]{.mark}

[**Anderson**: That\'s not what the Mariachi band says]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** But they\'re wrong! You\'re wrong! You\'re all wrong.
Bailey\'s, Frangelica\'s, Happy Schnapps - All those trucks belong to
the Don!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Exactly, and these Castalucci clowns are the Don.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** No! They\'re innocent! I\'ve seen the Don. It\'s not Rum
and its definitely not Raisin. It\'s some guy calling himself Don
Fettuccine!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Don\'t be ridiculous, that\'s a pasta..]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I promise you he\'s a real person. I\'ve met him.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** We\'re the police. Surely if he existed this Fetuccine
fella woulda come up on our radars at some point. I mean, where\'s the
Mariachi band singing about HIM?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** He had a song! But it didn\'t really take off.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Riiiiiight. So you\'re telling me that these Rum and
Raisin boys haven\'t got a drop of booze in their truck?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** No.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Rachel?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Not exactly. I mean, they do, but they\'re not like the
Don. They\'re nice, and kind,]{.mark}

> [and they\'re only doing it until their ice-cream business takes off.
> They\'re no criminal masterminds.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** They\'re bad people. They\'ve done something wrong and
they need to be punished.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** It\'s not about what\'s wrong or right]{.mark}

[The world is not so black and white]{.mark}

[You don\'t know why they broke the law]{.mark}

[You don\'t know what they\'re fighting for]{.mark}

[Cos sometimes good people]{.mark}

[Do bad things]{.mark}

[For all the right reasons]{.mark}

[Or so it seems]{.mark}

[So how do we know where to draw the line]{.mark}

[Between vigilance and crime]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** It\'s a slippery slippery slope]{.mark}

[For now they sell booze but eventually, dope]{.mark}

[It starts out all nice but the booze is a vice]{.mark}

[Down a slippery slippery slope.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You\'re wrong. They would never do that!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** It\'s a treacherous treacherous trick]{.mark}

[they claim they will stop but the sand here is quick]{.mark}

[I\'ve heard it all and I\'m not gonna fall]{.mark}

[for this treacherous treacherous trick]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[this crime is a gate-way the law doesn\'t wait,]{.mark}

[If we just let them walk then the people will talk]{.mark}

[and that is a slippery slope]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Ahrg. What is wrong with you? What happened to the real
Anderson? The Anderson who saved me from a life of crime and poverty?
What happened to him? You\'ve become obsessed, you\'re obsessed with
these two. What does it matter if a couple of people are still selling
booze? Why do you care so much?]{.mark}

[*Anderson is shocked. Nobody has spoken to him like this in a long
time*]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** You think booze is all fun and games, but it\'s not. It
destroys lives. For every joyous memory there\'s a hundred broken
dreams. It\'s a vile thing. People are drawn to it]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Just give me one more week! I\'ll find the Don, the real
Don I\'ll--]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Alright]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Thank you! You won't regret it]{.mark}

*[Exit Rachel.]{.mark}*

[**Anderson:** It\'s a slippery slippery slope]{.mark}

[For now they sell booze but eventually, dope]{.mark}

[You say that they\'re nice and you say that they\'re kind]{.mark}

[But I think those boys have corrupted your mind]{.mark}

*[Enter Gerald]{.mark}*

[**Gerald:** You wanted to see me?]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** I\'m worried about Rachel. I want you to keep an eye on
her. Something's not right.]{.mark}

law]{.mark}

[But now I just don't even know anymore]{.mark}

[What's wrong with their booze cream if no one gets hurt]{.mark}

[Judging a victimless crime is absurd]{.mark}

[And who is to say that the law maker's right]{.mark}

[Who gives them the power the right to decide]{.mark}

[Not I. Not I]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Rum? Hey it\'s me. Rachel. Hey, listen, is Raisin there?
Don\'t hang up! something big is going down; no, I\'m fine, but I need
to speak to you two. Yes, Raisin too. I know he\'s mad, but this is
important. Where? Sure. I\'ll be there soon.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** And I\....and I don\'t want to go.]{.mark}

[**Goon 2:** Mozarella?]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** Watermelon? God, what was her last name]{.mark}

[**Gerald:** Linguini?]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** Yeah! That\'s it. I knew it was some kinda fruit]{.mark}

[**Gerald:** Technically, that\'s a pasta]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** Whatever. Do you know where she is]{.mark}

[**Gerald:** Yeah, she\'s just over there]{.mark}

[**Goon 2:** Grazia]{.mark}

Goons]{.mark}*

[**Goon 2:** Yes.]{.mark}

[Raisin.]{.mark}

*[Pause]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** I\'m sorry. Look, I did what I thought was best; for you; I
was 12, how was]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You\'ve been lying to me for years. Everything was a
lie.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Don\'t say that!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** "Don\'t give up on dreams"?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That sounds like a good idea to me.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Says the guy living in his brother\'s ice-cream
truck]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Hey, I was doing really well until the prohibition came in.
And I don\'t mind living with you. It\'s been fun. And its not an ice
cream truck?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Its an ice cream trailer.]{.mark}

*[Pause]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Dad would\'ve been really proud.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Don\'t talk to me about dad. All that\...about dreams. I
don\'t know what to believe any more]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I don\'t know who I am any more.]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Don\'t say that! it\'s not true! You are your love for
ice-cream. That is you. The relentless optimism, that\'s you
too.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But it was all built on a lie]{.mark}

[**Rum:** What does it matter what its built on? All that matters is the
result. And that\'s you. Raisin. Raisini Castelucci. The best brother I
could ever ask for.]{.mark}

*[Pause]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** I'm so sorry.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Yeah]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Carl?]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** Who\'s Carl?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Nevermind, what do you want?]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** I got a message for ya from da Don.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** The Don! What does HE want?]{.mark}

[**Goon 1:** I don\'t know, It\'s hard to tell nowadays. It\'s like, he
always been a good Don, but lately, his hearts not in it. He keeps
talking some nonsense about opening some Italian restaurant or
something, I--]{.mark}

*[Rum and Raisin look confused]{.mark}*

[**Goon 1:** Oh, you mean what does he want with YOU. The message.
Right. It was something about some Linguine fruit or something. He said
if you ever wanted to see it again you\'d betta cease and
desist.]{.mark}

conversing on the phone]{.mark}*

am?!]{.mark}

[I\'m the Don! The DON! Dee Oh En. Yes, like the salami. No, I don\'t
want any salami-- (to the band) do you guys want any salami?]{.mark}

*[They mumble audibly]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Alright throw in some salami and a--]{.mark}

*[Two goons accompany Rachel and throw her down before the Don.]{.mark}*

[**Don**: Fine, just get me my food. Bye bye now.]{.mark}

[ (To Rachel) Why hello there, Rachel Linguini. I suppose you don\'t
know who I am; I am--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You\'re the Don]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m the who?-- I mean, what? how did you know?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** We\'ve met before.]{.mark}

[**Don:** But nobody ever remembers me]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What do you want from me?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I don\'t want anything from YOU. What I want is for your two
boyfriends to stop stealing my business. They\'ve made more in that
little truck of theirs in just a few weeks then I have with my entire
empire, ever. I thought if I could out-number them that maybe -- but no,
my trucks still aren\'t selling as well as there\'s, so I just need them
gone, out of my business and out of my life.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You could always ask]{.mark}

[**Don:** I\'m not in the business of asking. I have a reputation to
uphold, you know?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Suuuure.]{.mark}

[\
**Don:** So tell me, miss Linguine, what is it that makes their truck so
much better than mine?]{.mark}

[**Rachel** **:** Maybe if you spent less time kidnapping people and
more time--]{.mark}

[*The Don pulls out a torture device.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** (to the goons) Boys. Leave us.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You don\'t scare me!]{.mark}

*[The goons exit, laughing evilly. Once they\'ve left, the Don falls to
his knees and loses the]{.mark}*

*[accent.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Please. I am begging you. I just don\'t know what to do. I\'ve
tried everything. I\'m just no good at this mafia business.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I promise I won\'t hurt you or the boys. Just tell me what
makes their truck so successful]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Why should I tell you?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Look, I know I\'ve done some questionable things--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You kidnapped me!]{.mark}

[**Don:** Let\'s not put names on things, I mean, from some
perspectives, I just invited you for dinner--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** And tied me to a chair?!]{.mark}

[**Don:** I admit, that was a bit harsh, and probably unnecessary. Here,
let me --]{.mark}

[*The Don unties Rachel\'s hands*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Despite what you may think of me, I too am a victim of
circumstance.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** aw, yeah? How?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I wasn\'t always like this. Big-shot crime-lord.]{.mark}

[I too was once a child]{.mark}

[I remember growing up, Nona sat beside me]{.mark}

[We would make those pizza pies, Daddy\'s favourite meal.]{.mark}

[First we\'d kneed them, then the sauce, how I loved the cooking]{.mark}

[But Daddy said "it\'s not for you", and filled my hands with
steel]{.mark}

[Cos Daddy does what daddy says]{.mark}

[And what he says: must go]{.mark}

[And though I didn\'t know it then]{.mark}

[His plans for me were sewn]{.mark}

[Everyday I\'d go to school, no one sat beside me]{.mark}

[They would tease me, they were cruel, and I was all alone]{.mark}

[Well Daddy, he came home one day, saw that I was crying]{.mark}

[Nona begged "a real man cries" but daddy disagreed.]{.mark}

[And Daddy does what daddy says]{.mark}

[And daddy\'s word is law]{.mark}

[And so I had to dry my tears]{.mark}

[Or suffer Daddy\'s roar]{.mark}

[And all the times I tried to run away]{.mark}

[I\'d pack my bags and lock the door]{.mark}

[I never made it past the garden gate]{.mark}

[Cos what kind of man would I]{.mark}

[Be if I left my]{.mark}

[Nona with a man such as he]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[So I grew up and learnt the trade, lying cheating stealing]{.mark}

[I was only seventh grade when daddy, he got sick]{.mark}

[He said "It\'s time; Now you\'re the Don. Remember what I taught
you"]{.mark}

[And then he said "I love you son", and turned away to die.]{.mark}

[And Daddy did what daddy said]{.mark}

[And what he said: was true]{.mark}

[And though I hated what he did]{.mark}

[I knew what I must do]{.mark}

[So I donned the cursed name]{.mark}

[And I buried my head in the shame]{.mark}

[But I swore to protect those in need]{.mark}

[For the mob is vile disease]{.mark}

[And I\'ll tear it apart piece by piece]{.mark}

[And when my job is obsolete]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[I want to move on]{.mark}

[Get away from the Don]{.mark}

[And finally be]{.mark}

[Me.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Wow]{.mark}

[**Don:** So will you help me?]{.mark}

[*Rachel hesitates.*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Alright, but I\'m not doing this for you. And if you manage
to get back on your feet, you have to promise me that you\'ll make your
Nona proud and stop this whole mafia business.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Yes. Yes, I promise.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Well, I don\'t know, for starters, they make they\'re own
ice-cream]{.mark}

[**Don:** They have ice-cream?!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Yes, it\'s an ice-cream truck.]{.mark}

[**Don:** But I thought that was just a cover?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** So you\'re trucks don\'t even have ice-cream?]{.mark}

[*The Don starts to understand the logic. pulls out a notepad and starts
writing*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Go on]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Well\...they\...]{.mark}

[*Cut away.* *Rum and Raisin mount an assault on Mafia HQ (aka coffee
HQ). crash the truck through the gates and throw ice-cream at everyone.

[**Rum:** Desperate times?]{.mark}

comforting the Don who is crying on her shoulder.]{.mark}*

[**Rum:** Whaaa?]{.mark}

[**Don: \...**I just haven\'t been able to talk to anyone about it, you
know, since Nona died. I\'ve been so alone. I--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** It\'s good to let it out sometimes]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Rachel?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Is that\...the Don?]{.mark}

[*The don notices Rum and Raisin. Puts the accent back on, and plays the
tough guy.*]{.mark}

[**Don:** What are you two doing here?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We\'re here to rescue Rachel]{.mark}

[**Don:** She doesn\'t need rescuing. She\'s my guest]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But your goons told us--]{.mark}

[**Don:** Oh. Right. If you ever wanna see your friend Rachel Linguini
again--]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Really? After everything you just told me?]{.mark}

*[Don drops the pretence once more.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** Sorry, I\'m just so confused.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What\'s going on?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Long story, the Don\'s not actually a Don-- I mean he is,
but he\'s not the bad guy-- I mean-- I have something really important
to tell you]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You\'re not making any sense Rachel]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Let\'s get out of here before the cops arrive]{.mark}

[**Don:** The cops are coming?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We caused a bit of a ruckus getting in here.]{.mark}

[*Police sirens ring in the distance*]{.mark}

[**Don:** Right. Everyone, to the catacombs!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Or, we could just slip out the back door?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Right. Good point. Everyone, to the back door!]{.mark}

[*They go to leave.*]{.mark}

[**Voice Over:** Police! Open up!]{.mark}

[**Don:** Go. I\'ll handle this.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Thank you. For everything.]{.mark}

[**Police:** Where are they?]{.mark}

[**Don:** Where are who?]{.mark}

[**Don:** The great Rum and Raisin? Here?!]{.mark}

[**Police:** Don\'t play dumb. We know they\'re here. Their ice cream
truck is parked outside]{.mark}

[**Don:** Are you sure about that?]{.mark}

[*The sound of the ice-cream truck driving away. Cut to Rachel, Rum, and
Raisin in the ice- cream truck.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That was close!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** You have no idea.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Rum, I think it\'s time we moved on.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Yeah, we can get out of here. Hit another city, somewhere
without some--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I meant I think its time we closed up shop.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Closed up shop? But we\'re going so well, we\'ve only
just--]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We\'ve had a good run. I\'ve learned heaps. And now I have
something substantial to put on my application for the academy. But that
was too close. I don\'t want to end up in jail.]{.mark}

[*Rum looks at Raisin, and understands.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Alright. You\'re right. I\'m proud of you brother]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I\'m proud of you too.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m glad you two have made up. I agree, this whole
bootlegging thing has gone on]{.mark}

[**Rum:** But what about all our left over stock?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Well I suppose-]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I really think it would be a good idea if we just--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Maybe we have a closing down sale?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** No, guys that\'s a bad (idea)--]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Very moving. I think that-]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Hold on! That doesn't change anything. This is booze
we\'re talking about\...]{.mark}

[It\'s a slippery slippery slope]{.mark}

[For now they sell booze but eventually dope]{.mark}

[It starts out all nice but the booze is a vice]{.mark}

[Down a slippery slippery slope.]{.mark}

[**Rum and Raisin:** **Anderson:**]{.mark}

[I have a dream It\'s a treacherous treacherous trick]{.mark}

[A reason for living They say that they\'ll stop by the sand here is
quick]{.mark}

[A reason to get up in the morning I\'ve heard it all and I\'m not gonna
fall]{.mark}

[And smile for this treacherous treacherous trick]{.mark}

[Without a dream your nothing The crime is a gateway the law doesn\'t
wait]{.mark}

[And I won\'t be that guy If they walk then the people will talk]{.mark}

[I won\'t let them take my dream away And that is a slippery
slope]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Lovely boys. But that really doesn\'t change a thing. The
law is the law. Just because you dream about it doesn\'t make it legal.
I dream about burning this city to the ground. Do you think I can just
wake up one morning and do it? Of course not. And the same goes for you!
Now Judge; show me my justice. The prosecution rests]{.mark}

[**Rum:** (to Raisin) well, it was worth a shot.]{.mark}

[*Enter the Rachel with the Don disguised as a food and truck
administration inspector,*]{.mark}

*[Gareth Keenly.]{.mark}*

[**Judge:** It saddens me greatly to deliver this sentence on two such
fine young gentlemen]{.mark}

> [as yourselves, but he\'s right. The law is the law, and this

[**Rachel:** I object!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** You what?]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** What are you doing here? This is a trial, you cant just
barge in and shout that you object! What do you think this is? A
Wedding?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I\'m sorry we\'re late. This is Gareth Keenly.]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Gareth--?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Of the food and truck administration?]{.mark}

[**Don:** The one and only. I\'m here with some important last minute
evidence!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** This is highly irregular--]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Your honour you can\'t allow this.]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Are you telling me what I can and can\'t do in my own
courtroom? Let the man]{.mark}

> [speak.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** But your honour-]{.mark}

[**Judge:** You have a problem Mayor Anderson?]{.mark}

*[Gives him a death stare]{.mark}*

[**Anderson:** No your honour]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Go on Mr Keenly. I\'m ever so eager to hear what you have to
say]{.mark}

[**Don:** Like I was saying, my name is Gareth Keenly.]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Of the food and truck administration?]{.mark}

[**Don:** The one and only. Not long ago I conducted a routine health
and safety inspection under the guidelines of the food and truck hygiene
act of 1979. I assume you\'ve heard of it?]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Umm\....yes. I\'m a judge. Of course I have.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Well, as I inspected the truck licensed under the name Rum and
Raisin, I found a]{.mark}

> [few very interesting things.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** You have proof that these two are bootleggers?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I have the results of my inspection right here]{.mark}

[**Chorus:** A don don don don.]{.mark}

[**Don:** So your counter's rather glossy]{.mark}

[What\'s this temperature, its frosty]{.mark}

[I can see all your ice cream labels]{.mark}

[These are perfect power cables]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[You cones are stacked]{.mark}

[These things aren\'t cracked]{.mark}

[Tell me that\'s not a perfect packet]{.mark}

[]{.mark}

[Your shelves are full of ice cream spiders]{.mark}

[Here are all your flavour dividers]{.mark}

[So many ice cream scoops no tweezers]{.mark}

[There\'s a meat pie in you freezer]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Get to the bit about the alcohol]{.mark}

[**Don:** Well, your honour. That\'s the thing. There was no
alcohol.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** What?! That\'s impossible.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Its true. There wasn\'t a drop in the truck.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** But my men saw the bottles with their own eyes.]{.mark}

[**Don:** That may be, but the lab test showed that the liquids in the
truck had 0% alcohol content]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** What?!]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We change our plea to not guilty]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Done!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** You can\'t just change your plea!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** You wanna bet?]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** This is highly irregular.]{.mark}

[**Judge:** In light of new evidence provided by Mr Gareth Keenly, the
courtroom has changed its verdict: Rum and Raisin, not guilty.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Noooo!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** And in light of Mr Castelucci\'s dream, I would like to put
forth a motion to overturn prohibition. This fad has gone on long
enough.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** You blathering fools!]{.mark}

[*Chorus member takes a swig of booze. Anderson notices but thinks he's
imagining it.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** That\'s a bit dramatic.]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Do you know what you\'re doing? This is for your own
good! Don\'t you all realise? I did this for you! I did this to protect
you against yourselves.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What are you talking about?]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Prohibition. All of this was to protect you. All of you.
From yourselves. To stop]{.mark}

> [what happened to my poor brother, his beautiful life cut short by the

[**Judge:** As far as I\'m concerned, the only reason prohibition
happened is because of some]{.mark}

> [freak accident that caused the great Oktoberfest disaster]{.mark}
>
> *[Another chorus member takes a swig of booze. Anderson is getting

[**Anderson:** Freak accident? Do you really think the ropes of the
great oktoberfest tent just snapped by chance?]{.mark}

[**Judge:** What are you saying?]{.mark}

[*Rachel realises first*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Oh my god! It was you? You caused the Oktoberfest disaster?
You killed all those people! You killed hundreds of innocent
people?!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** They killed themselves! When they traded their life for
liquor]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I can\'t believe I worked for you! I trusted you!]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** Don\'t be so small minded. What\'s the life of a couple
of hundred to protect millions!]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** Protection? Who do you think you are?! What right do you
have to make that decision?! You\'re insane. You\'re a lunatic.]{.mark}

[*Another chorus member takes a swig of booze. Anderson is starting to
loose it.*]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** I am not insane!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Did you just admit to intentionally causing the great
Oktoberfest disaster??]{.mark}

[**Anderson:** I did no such thing.]{.mark}

[**Judge:** Did you intentionally cause the great Oktoberfest
disaster??]{.mark}

*[Anderson is losing it. Leo drinks a shot.]{.mark}*

**Anderson:** Your honour, this man is drinking booze in your courtroom!
Arrest him!

**Judge:** I didn\'t see anything. Did anyone else see anything?

*The chorus shake there head. Leo does another shot.*

**Anderson:** He did it again!

**Judge:** Mr Anderson, please stop wasting the court\'s time with false
accusations--

*The judge takes a swig from his flask*

**Anderson:** Did you just take a swig of booze?!

**Judge:** Mr Anderson, you are imagining things

**Anderson:** I saw you! It\'s a conspiracy! I demand a re-trial

**Judge:** This man needs urgent psychiatric help. Somebody call an
ambulance! He\'s hallucinating. He may become violent.

**Anderson:** I\'ll show you violent!

*Anderson launches himself at the Judge. Chorus subdue him and handcuff
him.*

**Anderson:** Gah! Yes. I caused the great Oktoberfest disaster. And
I\'m proud of it. You booze drinking swine all deserve to die! You\'re
already dead. In my mind, I burnt you with the rest of the city. I guess
dreams do come true.

**Judge:** Get him out of my sight.

**Anderson:** You haven\'t seen the end of me! You\'ll rue the day you
crossed me! I will have my vengeance!

*They drag him off.*

**Judge:** Well. Now that that\'s over and done with, let\'s put an end
to this ridiculous fad. I declare this prohibition overturned.

*Everyone cheers and whips out their booze.*

**Rum:** Do you even have the authority to do that

**Judge:** Who\'s gonna stop me? Cheers! But remember kids, enjoy
responsibly!

*[Everyone celebrates. It rains champagne.]{.mark}*

[**Don:** You got off lucky kids.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Because of you.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Thanks Don.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Don\'t call me that any more, I have left that name behind.
Call me by my real name, Donald. Donald Fettuccine, friendly family
chef. I\'ve just bought myself a nice little restaurant, my dream is
finally coming true.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What about the mafia? Whats going to happen to
them?]{.mark}

[**Don:** I need somebody to deliver my pizza, don\'t I? Anyway, I have
to go, so many Chef things to take care. I need to find out where you
can get those funny hats. Look after yourselves]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Best of luck to you. And thanks again.]{.mark}

[**Don:** Stop thanking me. It was her idea.]{.mark}

[*The Don exits. Rum and Raisin approach Rachel.*]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** I understand if you guys dont want-]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** We forgive you.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** to talk to me but-]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We forgive you.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** What?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You saved us.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** We forgive you]{.mark}

[*They hug.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** What are we going to do now?]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** We still have an ice cream truck.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** They confiscated everything in it.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** But we still have a truck.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** Roadtrip?]{.mark}

**[Rum &]{.mark}**

[**Rachel:** Yeah!]{.mark}

[*Postman rushes in*]{.mark}

[**Postman:** I\'ve got an emergency letter for Mr Castelluci!]{.mark}

[**Judge:** : Which one?]{.mark}

[**Postman:** Raisini. It\'s from Copenhagen!]{.mark}

[*Raisin opens the letter and looks at it.*]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Don\'t worry there\'s always next year.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I got in.]{.mark}

[**Rum**: What?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I got in! I got in. To Copenhagen.]{.mark}

[**Rachel:** That\'s amazing.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Yes! You did it!]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** This is it. This is what I\'ve been waiting for.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** So why do you look so upset?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I don\'t want to go]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Raisin, don\'t say that. Of course you do. This is what
you\'ve wanted for so long. And now you\'ve got your chance. don\'t just
pass it up. You\'re going to Copenhagen.]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I just\...I don\'t want to leave you guys, and the
truck.]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Who said you have to leave us?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** But--]{.mark}

[**Rum:** They have booze in Copenhagen, don\'t they?]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** You want to come with me?]{.mark}

[**Rum:** Of course kiddo. How else am I gonna get you in and out of
trouble]{.mark}

[*They rejoice. Copenhagen\'s Calling reprise.*]{.mark}

[**Raisin:** I fin\'lly got the letter]{.mark}
