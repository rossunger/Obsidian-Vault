[[Prince of Q|Quinn]], who would someday be the king of Q, awoke upside down, with hands tied to a bed frame. It wasn’t clear whose bed frame, but for Quinn this wasn’t unusual. They made little effort to uphold pretenses, even though they knew that the punishment was death, or worse: rehabilitation. Maybe it was because their father, who was the King of Q, had always bailed them out, even in the nastiest of nasties. 

As they looked around around the room for something to cut the ropes, Quinn jumped! They weren’t expecting to see the cloaked figure slouching in the love seat across the room. 

KING OF Q
If I’d known my son was queer I would found another way to deal with the anarchist rebellion. Have you seen the news?

QUINN
How did you find me?

KING OF Q:
You think I don’t know exactly where you are at every moment of the day?After last week’s fiasco?”   

QUINN
I gave Monico the slip

KING OF Q
Monico is not my only way of tracking you. Have you seen the news?

QUINN
Can you let me out of these?

KING OF Q
They’re saying I’m unfit to rule. They’re gonna push for a leadership challenge.

QUINN
That sucks  

KING OF Q
Do you know what this means?! Do you know what this means for YOU?  

QUINN
Nothing?  

KING OF Q
Do you know what they do to your kind? Do you know what they do to people like you?

QUINN
Fuck off, dad.  

*Pause*

KING OF Q 
I’m thinking of retiring

QUINN
Fuck dad, don’t joke about that  

KING OF Q
I’m serious. I’m tired of this shit. I thought I could fix everything but I’m just doing more of the same old shit.

QUINN
Can you at least sort out these fuckers 

KING OF Q
Don’t worry, I already had them executed. I’m just trying say that I won’t always be here to look out for you and get you out of trouble.

QUINN
You’re not really retiring

KING OF Q
I don’t know.

*KingQ leaves*

QUINN
Dad! Can you untie me? Fuck.
