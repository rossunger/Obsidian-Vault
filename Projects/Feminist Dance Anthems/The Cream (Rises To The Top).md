*A song about not being deterred by nay-sayers... and about patience*

**VERSE 1**
Haters gonna push you down, push you down, push you down
Serve you nonsense by the pound, by the pound, by the pound / ground /
found
Feeling like you're gonna drown, gonna drown, gonna drown
Even when they're not around, not around, not around

**CHORUS**
The cream, it rises to the top, it rises to the top, it rises to the top
Yeah the cream, yeah the cream, it rises to the top, it rises to the
top, it rises to the top
Yeah the cream, you're the cream

**VERSE 2**
Anyone can dish it out, dish it out, dish it out / without, drought,
shout
Fill you up with words of doubt, words of doubt, words of doubt,
Some people just like to shout
They don't know what they're talking 'bout,

**CHORUS**

**BRIDGE**

But we will rise above
And face the world with love
And sometimes, yeah, it's hard
And life just leaves you scarred
But you don't have to worry

**CHORUS**

~~Haters gonna push you down, push you down, push you down~~

~~Tell you that you're not enough, not enough, not enough~~

~~Anyone can dish it out, dish it out, dish it out~~

~~They don't know what they're talking 'bout, talking 'bout, talking
'bout~~

~~But we ain't gonna take that on, take that on, take that on~~
