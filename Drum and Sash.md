Our implementation science project builds on the work of the Aboriginal Community Resilience to HIV & AIDS (ACRA - CIET Canada N. Andersson 2008-2012) project and the Development of a Rural Model for Integrated Shared Care in First Nation and Métis Communities (DRUM) project (C. Worthington, Alexandra King 2013-2018). The focus of our research is Indigenous-led responses to the disproportionate burden of HIV, HCV, and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) and related mental health issues and stigma in Indigenous communities.  
  
We received additional funding in 2018 to expand DRUM to include new Indigenous partners. The DRUM project was renamed DRUM &amp; SASH to honour the addition of the Métis Nation of Alberta partnership. Shared care approaches use the skills and knowledge of a range of health professionals and community members who share joint responsibility in relation to an individual’s care.   
  
Our project aims to support the following:  

- addressing the unmet health needs of First Nation and Métis people, specifically relating to HIV, Hep C, STBBI and related mental health and stigma;  
- support communities in developing a cultural response to Hep C, STBBI and related mental health and stigma by helping them create community partnerships and collaboration of resources essential to develop wholistic linkage-to-care opportunities;
- support community-to-community mentoring and knowledge-sharing opportunities to promote capacity building and strengthening.

  
DRUM & SASH (D&S) was funded to engage with First Nations and Métis communities in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The project integrates community-based and Indigenous understandings of culturally safe and responsive programming and ways of assessment with  
western academic ways of program development, implementation, and evaluation.  
In its partnerships, the D&amp;S project works with communities by:

- providing funding support to hire a lead from the community that will work with the project team in achieving the community’s priorities;
- providing Community Readiness Assessment (CRA) training to help develop evidence-based interventions, and providing ongoing support to the community to facilitate the project.
