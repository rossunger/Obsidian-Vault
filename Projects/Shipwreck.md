When I walked in to meet you, you were glowly.
Simply glowing. With a warm angelic halo round your soul.

Then you showed me who you were, you were an angel. A guardian angel,
here to help me through the darkest darkest days

And you told me that I too was like an angel,
And I'm here to help you. I was here to help you,

And it felt like we'd been calling out across the universe,
and it brought us here together for a purpose yet unknown
And the way that I feel drawn to you it's hard not to believe

That you and I we've got:
Magnetic blood
Magnetic blood
Magnetic blood

And sometimes when we touch it feels like light shoots out our eyes,
and we don't know whats allowed, but normal rules do not apply

We try to take is slow but we're just bursting full of flux
And the way that I feel drawn to you it's hard not to believe

That you and I we've got:
Magnetic blood
Magnetic blood
Magnetic blood

You were stuck in a luxury cage that they said was your home
You were stuck and you'd tried to get out, but it's all you have known
You were stuck dropping hints, leaving notes, of how you're screaming inside
And you breathe through the gaps in the bars, but you're not quite alive

But I see you, and I hear you and I promise I will help to get you out.
If you want that, I'll be waiting, you just say the word

You were stuck and you wanted to leave without breaking the door
You were stuck, holding space, playing nice, breathing smoke more and more
Cos the fires you tried to suppress were getting outta control
You were stuck, burning down, breaking up, getting outta the hole

But I see you, and I hear you and I promise I will help to get you out.
If you want that, I'll be waiting, 
you just say the word, we'll break the damn door down

It's kinda quiet. Kinda lonely. 
But you know there was no other way to go.

Maybe something new will happen
Maybe we just have to wait
Maybe someday soon these Angels
could be more than helping hands.

Anticipation. Unknown waters. 
Burning passions just beneath what lies below.

Now we're waiting for an answer.
Now we're waiting for the call
Should we build a life together
Form a family in this home?

We got the call.
Divine intervention.
Almost broke my skull
Made me pay attention

Nurses taking my blood
3 or 4 times a day
Doctors scan my brain
Making sure I'm ok

And I guess I feel fine
I can tell you the time
I can wiggle my toes
I can breath through my nose

And it rings in my ear
And I'm stuck sitting here
Under florescent lights
Slowly losing my mind

But you, you never leave my side.
And we, We know I nearly died
And maybe it's the medicine we needed
An answer to a prayer we had long conceded

And it feels like crystal waters
Like the universe is for us
And the purest call from spirit
So clear you can't not hear it

And we're meeting at the source
And life is opening all doors
And our destiny if coming
Yeah our destiny is coming

And we're in this now together
And we tie this holy tether
And no life nor death can sever it
All storms will have to weather it

Because this life is sacred
this life is sacred
Sacred
Sacred
Sacred
Sacred

I accept there are things in this world that we cant understand
And the words that we speak can't explain what we feel in our hands
Yet we try, hear me speak, feel the truth sinking further away
And I not sure I know what you think that you just heard me say

All I know is I don't trust the words
And trying to communicates absurd
No promises or answers could shed any natural light
To scare away the shadows that you're running from at night

And faith, faith is all I've got.
And trust, trust in what is what
Just lis'ning to our bodies, and that's all that we can do
What does your body tell you, will I be here for you?

And I might have to leave you for a year
If i get the call from spirit, calling me so clear
And does that still feel right for you, when you look beyond the fear?
Then I stand by our choice and trust the universe to steer

We built a ship to take us far from this place
To carry our hearts, made to look like our face
From blood we forged our compass, our passions filled the sail,
We were floating on the high winds with a map that's made of Kale

And we don't really know what we're looking for,
and we don't really know what's ahead
but there's nowhere to go, and there's nothing to know,
and we may as well shoot for the moon

Now the boat starts feeling smaller by the moment
And youre squeezing me so hard that I can't breathe
And I think I need to get off off this island
Before i lose my mind and drink the sea

And I don't understand it, how can you not feel it?
Or maybe you just don't know what it means?
I try to find the words but they're slipping through my fingers
Ive got porcupine quills growing out my spine

And it's hurting you
But you won't let go
And it's hurting me
But I still don't know why

And we're tryna find the light
To hear the spirits talk at night
We just don't know what isn't right
and I'm starting to lose sight of who we are
And why we're here
What is this feeling, and getting lost in fear
And I can't hear you, and nothing's clear
And we've long forgotten, someone's meant to steer

*Turbulence*

We searched every corner
Tryin'a find the leak
We're shoveling out water
But it's hopelessly bleak

I'm praying for guidance,
And I'm searching for land
Cos I know what's ahead of us, 
and the sacrifice it demands

And there's no time for tears if we want to survive
Gotta get to the lifeboats before we capsize

Leave your stuff, 
leave the jewels, 
leave the food if you must
No you can't take the boat, 
you just have to trust

# 8
This boat was a gift, precious cargo, now we're sending it back
It's not time, gotta figure out life, clean our ears and our throats
Learn to swim, and let go of all the garbage that's weighing us down
Can't bring life to this world when our love can't even keep us afloat

Now I'm floating in a Lifeboat, watching you drown,
And I see that you are screaming but I don't hear the sound
I keep reaching out to help you, but its pushing you down
Maybe sometimes the only way through is to drown

But I make it sound so easy
I can see it's not so easy
Not for you it's not so easy
It's not easy It's not easy
Even hard is not the word
Maybe brutal? more than brutal
Inconceivable at least
Deconstructive
Self destructive
What's the point?
Am I not dead?
I'm a killer,
I'm a killer,
Why'd I kill her?
Why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why

# 9
Overnight the world shut down
Time stood still, as I watched you eternally drown
And I try to show up but there's walls made of glass I can't see
completely surrounding me

So I'm stuck, all alone, in this box gently floating at sea
Don't know what I should do, take some time, start a working on me
Just pretend life goes on, breathe some air, maybe that's what we need.
Oh my god that feels good give me more give air let me breathe

How did this love become a cage that we couldn't escape?
What did I do that was wrong? That we were held up by tape?
And oh was it wrong that i tried to get offa that boat?
Could it be that we just needed time to get over the hump?
Or would we have kept sinking? Never realising we're drowning
In the piles and piles of baggage, you know,the kind you can't donate?

Does it matter she was different? That this love was so divine?
Was I right to trust the lessons that I'd learned so many times?

We both know how special is this precious love we got
The tragedy is even so we can't be what we're not

Theres nothing left to do but wait

# 10
You're here like a Fury
tryna dish out my fate
But I didn't drown you,
I just couldn't relate

Thank the gods who grant me passage
to get safely to the courts
And I trust, the sentence: peaceful.
Cos they know what's in our hearts

We need time.
Time
Time. It takes time for things to shift
Time. We need time to start to heal
Time. Lots of time. With a tiny pinch of space
And a faith in our future, future of the human race

# 11
Every time you see me moving 
I know it's adding to your pain
It's a shame we're tied by threads 
that show you ever single day

And I wish that I could freeze for you, 
but Ive still gotta breathe
And work on all that baggage that 
I can't convince to leave

And it's still hurting, slowly, 
and it makes me cry
And I don't believe 
that we ever really die

And I trust in life 
to give what is needed 
even if it feels bad or makes
me feel depleted

It's a gift and I accept, 
time for sadness and to reflect

# 12
It's over. 
This phase with us is over
And when i think of all we've lost, i cant believe my mind

I want you, i want you, 
I always will want you

And if I trusted less 
then maybe I would wonder
If this was all was just some mistake
That I didn't have to make, 
to make, to make

If right now we could be happy
With a life of changing nappies

But the lessons come for reasons
And I've subscribed to all the seasons
I hope someday that I can see 
why this all happened to you and me

And I pray for your safe keeping
And I wish you peaceful sleeping
And I know that someday we will meet again
And it might not be this lifetime

But our thread is 
forever woven 
forever woven
forever woven in the fates

# 13
there's a hollow house, 
that I barely step foot in now
Somehow I can't decide to leave it behind

bare, empty rooms 
full of miserable memories
Fragments of dreams that had driven us blind

You took our bed, 
and I've been sleeping outside
Cos all of the ghosts and the echoes 
had been playing tricks on my mind

And somedays it feels like we're gonna be fine
But the winter is cold, and the healing takes time

So I sit and I pray
And I count all the ways
That the choices I made brought me here

Twists of fate, loaded die,
This is the first time that I let myself cry
For I gave up the things I held dearest
