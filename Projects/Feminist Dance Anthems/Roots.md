There's a treasure trove of knowledge that we carry in our bones
Our parents, and their parents' parents, things they all have known
And often when you're feeling lost, or don't know what to do
Just make some space and answers will become available to you

Tap into your roots and tap into your power
Rituals and truths that make grown men cower
We know how to save the world if we just dig deep
Grandmothers and fathers, great spirit, creator
Help me find my roots, feel the earth, appreciate her
I'm praying for some help to show up in a good way
Help me show up in a good way

It's a slow and painful process to decolonize our minds
To uncover and unpack the years of patriarchal lies
Like whiteness as a culture or the ownership of land
But as you leave it all behind you'll understand why you must find your
way home

Tap into your roots and tap into your power
Rituals and truths that make grown men cower
We know how to save the world if we just dig deep
Grandmothers and fathers, great spirit, creator
Help me find my roots, feel the earth, appreciate her
I'm praying for some help to show up in a good way
Help me show up in a good way

And sometimes it's hard to
Stay present and clear
And sometimes we're lost in
Waves of Trauma and fear
Sometimes the noise of every day life
Makes it hard to hear
One foot in this world and one with spirit

Tap into your roots and tap into your power
Rituals and truths that make grown men cower
We know how to save the world if we just dig deep
Grandmothers and fathers, great spirit, creator
Help me find my roots, feel the earth, appreciate her
I'm praying for some help to show up in a good way
Help me show up in a good way

~~But as you strip away and step into lthe truth you'll start to
understand why you must~~

~~There's something that's been bothering me that I can't ignore~~

~~A culture that's stolen culture and the land and so much more~~

~~I want to connect again with roots of ancient knowledge~~

~~But first I have some reparations that I need to acknowledge~~

~~I can't ignore my privilege, but whiteness is a curse~~

~~That robs you of your culture, it's still trying to coerce~~

~~The world into a game of us and them, but I refuse to play along~~

~~So let us lift this veil of whiteness without forgetting what it's
means~~
