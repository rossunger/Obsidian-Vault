IDEAS  

Denizens of venison
In designated garrisons
Accommode unconsciously
Gesticulating warning signs
Foregoing Golden cortisols
For sentimental going ons
And embryonic pensioners
Accumulate attention spans
Through patented technologies
That are forged by ideologies
Who divisively and Decisively
distort the worlds they pride themselves on
Fermenting foreign sanctuaries
  
  

My friendships duly dulled by losses to restrictive kindship clauses caused me catastrophic consequences, and citing fatal flaws for sentences I found myself contempted, says the jury to the arbiter: this house is full, it's far fitter for this fowl to forfeit furtive fenses than expect us lower our defences, hence, there's nothing left to do but send them to the outskirts of our forking friend group,

  
  

then unceremoniously relegated

  
  
  

Pestering the Jester with vague requests for breaking bread, the Baker, half impressed by by tender tendencies, fights slander with a slender gratitude directed at his long lost friend in hopes that maybe in the finite future facts emerge and culminate in a constellation that's allowing them to once again butt heads, hold hands, to one another understand, and granted maybe now the moment's passed and the timeline's ended, not every broken promise poorly brokered's destined to be mended

  
  
  

Disfunctional disentanglement from disingenuous degenerates promptly turns a sweet taste sour as the power that I abdicate leaves a void apt to eradicate the foundational sensation that bore the burgeoning of my creation, all the blood and sweat and tears I tried to trade for transcendentalism, but the trauma is generational, so I fixate on the irrational, and I break from the traditional, and this phase is just transitional, 

  
  
  

Destitute, I obsess with you,
over pesticides, in the country side,
where the best us, played the festivals,
where the guests of ours, were intensified,
by the words we said, and the prose we read,
And the harmonies that we cultivated,
And the Vortices that we propagated
Pleasantries that we escalated
Delegating serenading
Elevating promenading
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

I'm furious, fighting the ongoing urge
to demolish the delicate tower, to purge
all the lifelines that failed me before,
I'd take derilict wastelands to feelings of falling some more,
all the spirits so noisy they can't be ignored,
all the movement so nauseous it's shaking my core,
I'm a Phoenix, a Lucifer, burning my sword,
and I'm vanishing, brandishing blemishes stemming from well-wishing relatives relishing parenting overly centering learning and mentoring
Constantly countering counselling, cancelling
Out all the hope and precision, with layers of
doubt, how to cope, and derision,
I never learnt how to make solid decisions

  
  
  
  

This is not a time for pastimes

  
  
  

Gallivanting salamanders gratifying ex-commanders

Testifying _ glampers

Satisfying 

  
  

What I've learned from phones about my lovers
Is that you can't unbreak a broken screen
You could replace it with another
But the price is far too steep
You can't unsay a tone that's harsh
You can't unhurt a wounded heart
You can't unblurt out false retorts
You can't undoom what's torn apart

  

You only get one strike, don't blow it

Even a case will not protect them
From a drop at certain heights

Charge them frequently, and fully
(And update software when you can?)

  
  
  

There's a golden path of balance and I keep tryin'a walk it
But it's hidden from view and it twist and turns without warning
Though you know when you're on it, you can't always see it's directions
With it's higher dimensions, good luck making conscious corrections

  

I keep following breadcrumbs only to falter and stumble
Then I sit and I wait and I pray for the strength to be humble.
In the stillness of silence I might have a chance still to find it

  
  

Spirits help me find that Golden path
Help me walk in balance and relax
Grant me wisdom strong enough to see it
Grant me patience long enough to be it



What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
Gonna settle up before you're in the ground

Ive been learning what it means to respect your elders
Never trusted 'em before, cos we were disconnected
All my relatives were broken by what life subjected them to
And I couldn't handle it so I rejected them too

What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
I wanna settle up before I'm in the ground

I've been learning what it means to really be authentic
How to value all your gifts and drop the sycophantics
How to listen to your body, not dissect semantics
How to validate your wants and needs without demanding
  
What comes around goes around
Yeah your kharmic debts they go up and down
And you pay the price, just maybe not right now
I wanna settle up before I'm in the ground
  
Ive been learning how to carry on when life is blinding
How to balance without feet and keep yourself reminding
That you know what you must do now even though it's grinding
  

  
I guess I'm learning how to be myself
To open and embody all the parts that many someone's previously ruled were too obnoxious or profound
I guess somehow I let their many voices blister and compound into a
monolithic weight that slowly crushed my spirit into
bonsai boxes
Once I locked

  

But now I'm grounded in the teachings

  

Im both vociferous and loud
I watch the words fall out my mouth
Before I've had a chance to think them
Blink, and here they are
Delivering the kinda truth bombs that I only wish I knew
But when it's spirit talking you just take the cue and follow suit and let the cards play out and hope you've got the strength to follow through

  
  
  
  

I'm frothing at the mouth

  
  
  
  
  

The winds of change are raging,
Staging new beginnings,
Thinning out the weeds of now
that once were cherished dearly for their fruit and flowers,

  

How do I accept that every season all the islands holding me begin to sink down
Leaving me to flounder till I let myself drown
Escaping to the other side to find a new home
Rake the leaves of friendships with a fine comb
Measure by the pain how much we've all grown
Synchronize our watches and let time flow
Ride the winds and waves and venture without eyes into the unknown

Watch the pretty patterns escalate 

  
  
  
  

Tension and release
A mighty penchant for your dis-ease
Story arcs of suffering find
hearty homes in those who seek peace
Doing as you please,
Constructed like a cryptic crossword in a foreign tongue, deciphering mixed messages
  
  
Exhausted from this perfectly preposterous
psuedo-parasitic hyper-analytic never ending
high-stakes friend or long-lost-lover heart and mind trip,
where we're burning, slowly bonding,
turning over past mistakes,
examining absurdly all the unexpected cuts and breaks

  

that crept into a crypt of critical but crumbled doorways,
crumpled letters to a younger self lamenting loss of all the lives you could have once lived
Torturing yourself for all the unknown choices that you made while still a wee kid
Recycling old stories with a new twist
Withering away despite a horde of bright gifts
Punishing yourself each time the fading light shifts
Pushing us away

  
Gargantuan entanglements
With broken brains and mangled tents
And passengers defenestrating
Sacred things we'd venerated
Can't lock doors with tuck-taped windows
Can't butt horns with rock and splinters
Can't break bread with hostile victims
Can't repair decaying systems
  

De-fibrillate my fibrous vessels and let the
tessellated Western sediments
re-surge as restless testaments to
how much work is still ahead of us
enormous burnt impediments
descend on us
where residents
break bank to live in tenements
