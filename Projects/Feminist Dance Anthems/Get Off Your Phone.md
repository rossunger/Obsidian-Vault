*A song about being addicted to our phones*

Hard to admit the truth, But my brain's feeling conflicted
I try to put you down, But baby I'm addicted
You're ringing in my ear, And buzzing in my pocket
I try to let you go, but it's too late
We both know I just can't wait

Boop Boop Boop. Gotta check that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta snap that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta send that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta tap that

Oh my god I'm, Stuck in traffic
Social media, Demographics
Is my news feed, too Pornographic?
All this content is biographic
IRL's fine, But is it holographic?
The mems are great if, they're photographic
I wish more friendships were geographic
Instead I'm here with my phone, fucking classic

There's something very wrong, I just don't understand it
I wish that we could stop, in fact, we should demand it
But we're so scared of being bored, don't want our friends to feel
ignored
Strung out on dopamine rewards, All hail our digital overlords

Boop Boop Boop. Gotta check that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta snap that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta send that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta tap that

Oh my god I'm, Stuck in traffic
Social media, Demographics
Is my news feed, too Pornographic?
All this content is biographic
IRL's fine, But is it holographic?
The mems are great if, they're photographic
I wish more friendships were geographic
Instead I'm here with my phone, fucking classic

It's time to make a change, to set my phone on silent
To let the wifis go, and stand up to this tyrant

*Ok everyone. Here's the deal. For the next two minutes, we're gonna put
down our phones and get down with it*

Boop Boop Boop. Gotta check that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta snap that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta send that
Boop Boop boop, Gotta tap that

Oh my god I'm, Stuck in traffic
Social media, Demographics
Is my news feed, too Pornographic?
All this content is biographic
IRL's fine, But is it holographic?
The mems are great if, they're photographic
I wish more friendships were geographic
Instead I'm here with my phone, fucking classic

I'm on a phone timeout

Present in the real world / present in the i r l
In the fomo, fear of missing out
I'm anxious feeling awkward
I don't know where to look
I'm trying to be social
When I see what I've become, I just wanna yell
Oh my god, get off your phone,
And maybe I'm just anxious cos there's
Somewhere I'd rather be
Meeting other friends or lovers
There's endless possibilities
When you talk to me I wanna talk to you
And not pretend to be, but have my brain be glued to a
Screen in my hand, where the apps all demand
That I talk to them, cos they talk to me
There are elephants in the room
And they're sucking our attention
You gotta new message,
Are you gonna check it?
Can you hear me talking?
are you really present?
I'm sick of seeing the world through the eyes of my phone
Trying to capture a moment, taking a video makes us miss the real life
moment

Wifi is like islands... lost at sea ... drought,
We're Sailing wifi islands,
Noise and signal...
losing signal? get connected
