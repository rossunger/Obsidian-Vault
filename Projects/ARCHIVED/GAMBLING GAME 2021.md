# GAMEPLAY

GAME PITCH

-   you play as the spirit of a dying town, witnessing and subtly
    > influencing the people living here, as they face both personal
    > challenges, and the challenge of keeping the town alive in the
    > face of changing times and capitalist/colonial oppression.

POTENTIAL DESIGN PILLARS

-   Everyone is important / has a role to play

-   Together we are more than the sum of our parts

-   Teach/lead by example

-   Everyone is on their journey (not our place to judge or understand)

-   Being witnessed is profoundly impactful

-   Small changes can have big impacts

-   Deep change/trust takes time and commitment

-   2 eyed seeing, 2 heart feeling

-   You can\'t change a person, only Modify the environment to help them
    > heal and grow

-   Relationality

-   Noticing, witnessing, sitting with, giving attention to... these are
    > the main verbs of the game

-   You can only follow characters that can sense you... And as
    > characters open up spiritually, you\'re able to connect with more
    > and more characters

-   

MOOD

-   hope

-   Childlike authenticity

Question:

-   What if the main verb of the game is to witness?

    -   maybe characters are stuck in indecision, or blinded by a lack
        > of awareness, and being witnessed helps them move through
        > their blocks? maybe they're lying to themselves, or alway
        > looking outwards, and being witnessed helps them to look
        > inwards?

-   Can the town spirit embody animals? And certain clairvoyant people?

-   What if characters have internal dissonance blocks, and you help
    > them? E.g. They want to talk about their addiction, but they're
    > blocked by stigma, and they protect their "blocks" by using anger,
    > or indifference, but if they can feel safe enough to open up, then
    > they can tap into what they really want

-   A variation on the game where you replay the same day over and over,
    > but each time the changes stick, and you can add new changes...?
    > Or maybe this applies to the whole game???

-   Does each character have a set of milestones, with different
    > possible outcomes depending on ?

-   What if only some people are open to being influenced? Maybe this is
    > connected to their spirituality? You can still watch the others,
    > just can't change anything

-   When can you change which character you follow? Once per game? Or
    > once per day? Or anytime?

-   Is the town spirit a child?? Maybe we don\'t find that out until
    > later

-   The first character you follow had just moved to town, so that
    > player and character are aligned in their understanding is what\'s
    > going on and who is who

-   What if the town being childlike justifies a scenario where the town
    > can make changes but not really understand the outcomes? Like they
    > can blow away an important looking document, but they don\'t know
    > what the document does until they see a character react to it
    > being missing

walking / exploring / remembering where things are

-   wasd

-   map? that grows as you explore?

-   Mischief:

    -   Gust of wind

    -   Shapeshift (into animal)

    -   Storm (clouds rain lightning)

    -   Light a spark?

    -   Hold their hand (increase confidence)

    -   Chill their spine (increase doubt/foreboding)

    -   Scramble their senses (makes them delay the decision)

    -   

listening to people talk / watching people do things

-   cutscenes

-   Snapshots that capture milestones/important or defining moments in
    > time for each character...

-   Types of sequences:

    -   Fixed Events: core story, at specific time, and place

    -   Time specific e.g. only during Halloween, or only at night time

    -   Site specific e.g. only at the market, only in the suburbs, only
        > in nature

    -   Prerequisite events e.g. characters must be friends, or if town
        > voted X

player (spirit of the town) vs character (character might resist doing
what you want)

-   nudge character to make simple choices (talk/stay silent, vote,
    > etc)\... Nudge their heart, brain, or gut

-   resistance meter: how reluctant the character is to sway from their
    > pre-programmed path

-   Upgrade spirit of the town (each neighbourhood has its own spirit
    > too!)

    -   Personal

        -   Improve communication with humans

        -

        -   Increase neighbourhood collaboration

town health meter

-   bringing people together, facing challenges, etc. increases town

-   lower town health results in more "for sale" signs on houses, more
    > homeless people, moodier characters, more shady business people
    > showing up in town
