A nonprofit started by Ross Unger and Katie Macdonald in 2016

## What We Do
We hire artists to help community groups make musicals, films, video games, and other art about local issues. We run workshops, host events, and put together projects based on the needs that we see in our community.

## Our Goals
We are a not-for-profit organisation that aims to:
- Create and present story-based art such as films, musicals, websites, songs, and games to raise awareness of social justice issues.
- Amplify marginalised voices by supporting collaborations between community members and professional artists.
- Support diversity in the arts industry
- Provide arts mentorship to our communities
