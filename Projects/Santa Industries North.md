WHAT WE LOVE

-   Corporate allegory
    
-   putting on a happy face
    
-   the darkness...all the toys are former employees,...happy child labor...reindeer globally humiliated with his nose
    
-   rules
    
-   Santa=real business person...victim of a system
    
-   Charlie wanting to seduce santa
    
-   Charlie as the villain
    
-   the idea of everyone being who they’re not
    
-   Santa: everyone wants something from me
    
-   Carol: just wanting to find someone special
    
-   Happy: terrible at logistical things...I just wanna make art
    
-   Rudolf: entitled...wanting to be appreciated/needed/celebrated. Fear of being old/redundant...fear of being past your prime
    
-   Charlie: fake, loud, immoral...realises she hates herself...party girl
    

  
  
  
  

IDEAS

-   can we start with Santa promoting Happy? get around a lot of exposition
    
-   can Happy choose some audience members to be his “family”?
    
-   I wanna see a scene where they attend the union
    

-   if there’s a gun on the wall, someone should fire it 
    

-   can we hear Pinky screaming for help throughout the play, and santa covering it up?
    

-   It doesn’t feel right for santa to have killed pinky. Maybe he commited suicide?
    

-   does happy really fantasize about killing santa?? if anything, he’d have beef with the reindeer.
    
-   rudolf as a child star?? the corruption of fame, addiction. rudolf as Macaulay Culkin
