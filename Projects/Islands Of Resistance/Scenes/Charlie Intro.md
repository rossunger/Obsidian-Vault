[[Charlie]] was not well suited for working with artists. She could schmooze
the face off a potential investor, but artists were a particular kind of
delicate flower that pushed all her buttons, and not in a good way.

She had agreed to take on [[Hoeven]] as a favour to a friend, who had
discovered them before they were big, and despite the enormous success
that had come of it, she sometimes missed the good old days when she
could work exclusively with the people she cared about. She'd started
as a refugee lawyer and only became an agent when she realised there was
a loophole that allowed her to sponsor people if she could prove that
they would contribute significantly to the artistic landscape of the
nation, and while it's true that the income Hoeven brought in was the
only reason she was able to continue operating, she couldn't help
resent the work she had to do for them.

Poor [[Sahdie]] was sitting in the waiting room, and now she would have to
tell him that she had to reschedule their appointment. Of course he
wouldn't mind, he was the most grateful human she's ever met, but the
principle of it pissed her off. Stupid bigshots swooping in and causing
havoc whenever they felt like it.

city.
