What does good support look like? How can we ask for help? How do build resilient networks of deep care? How do we show up for each other in a meaningful way

This is a self-help pamphet. This is performance art. This is peer support.

DEEP CARE 2019

RECOGNISING TOXICITY 2020

Free Consultations

Free Consultations is a performance art piece exploring the concept of
support.

-   How can we support each other better?

-   How can we ask for help?

-   How can we communicate when we are unable to offer support?

Guidelines

-   You can stop at any point.

-   If it gets too intense, ring the bell followed by a moment of
    > silence.

-   Conversations can be serious or light-hearted.

-   Take a break if you need and come back when you're ready.

-   Ask open ended questions.

-   Don't offer unsolicited advice.

-   Assume nothing.

-   Discuss confidentiality beforehand.

Where To Begin

-   Sit in the chair. Introduce yourself. Share your NAME and PRONOUNS

-   If you would like to practice support, ask an opening questions:
    > "how are you feeling?", or "what's been on your mind lately?"

-   If you'd like to receive support, ask for help: "Do you think you
    > could help me with something?"

Useful Phrases

-   Can you tell me more about that?

-   Where do you feel that in your body?

-   Do you want advice, or do you want me to just listen?

-   How do you feel about that?

-   How are you reacting to that?

-   Can we take a break? I'm feeling overwhelmed and I need some time to
    > regroup.

-   I don't have capacity to support you right now. I need some space.

-   That sounds hard.

INTRODUCTION

Life is hard. The world is cold. We can all use a little help sometimes.
Who am I kidding. Most of us can use a lot of help all the time. If only
we could help each other.

**[Disclaimer: What this manual is and is not]{.underline}**

What this manual is not:

-   A solution to all your problems

-   A "correct way" to support someone

**[Anatomy of a human support system]{.underline}**

Asking for help =\> Offering support (or not) =\> Receiving support =\>
Expressing gratitude

BASIC PRINCIPLES

1)  The person receiving support does all the work. You are just
    > facilitating. You are not solving their problems, even when you
    > offer advice.

2)  Ask open ended questions. An open ended question gives no suggestion
    > as to what the answer could be. If you have a thought or a
    > judgement, you can reframe it as a question.

3)  Offer advice only when requested. You can ask "are you wanting
    > advice, or would you like me to just listen?"

4)  Let time be endless. You can't rush support. You can take breaks and
    > return to it later, and have boundaries, but you can't be a good
    > support if you don't carve out time for it.

5)  Useful phrases:

    a.  Can you tell me more about that?

    b.  Where do you feel that in your body?

    c.  Do you want advice, or do you want me to just listen?

    d.  How do you feel about that?

    e.  How are you reacting to that?

    f.  Can we take a break? I'm feeling overwhelmed and I need some
        > time to regroup.

    g.  I don't have capacity to support you right now. I need some
        > space.

    h.  That sounds hard.

\
QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE

-   When do you feel supported?

-   What are some experiences of support that you\'ve had that were
    > positive?

-   What do you do if you don\'t have capacity to support?

-   How do you ask for help?

-   How do you like to give support?

-   How does it feel to receive/not receive support?

USEFUL TECHNIQUES

**[Assess the situation]{.underline}**

Do they need you to listen, or are they looking for advice?

Are they in a headspace to be solving problems, or do they need to
de-escalate their emotions first?

**[Be present and listen]{.underline}**\
"How are you feeling?"\
"Do you want to tell me more about that?"

"Where are you feeling that in your body?"

**[Rainy day plan]{.underline}**\
Make a plan for how to be supported when they're having a hard time.

E.g. "Let's make a list of 5 people you can message when you're feeling
isolated. Let's draft the message that you can send"

Practice walking through the steps together.

**[Mantras and reassurances]{.underline}**\
"What's you're experiencing sounds really hard, but youre gonna make it
through this."

"I'm feeling a lot of things in this moment, but these feelings are
temporary"

SESSION 1 (Sahara Ken Steph Jacob Ross):

Questions we asked ourselves:

-   When do you feel supported?

-   What are some experiences of support that you\'ve had that were
    > positive

-   What do you do if you don\'t have capacity to support

Some of the answers:

-   Listen

-   invite me even if I can\'t make it

-   ask if they want advice, for you to listen, to be distracted,

-   say \"that sounds really hard\" and \"you\'re gonna make it, is
    > gonna be ok\"

-   don\'t assume you know or could possibly understand someone\'s
    > experience

-   don\'t fill in the blanks, or try to relate it to your experience

-   take turns talking about your experience

-   affirm safety without explaining why

-   ask before sharing your experience

-   ask questions instead of offering answers

-   don\'t try to cheer up, unless asked

-   if asked, maybe share a story, or happy memories together, or other
    > \... Maybe go for a meal together or distracted in other ways

-   view yourself as a support, nor a savior, and you don\'t have to
    > drown with them

-   showing up for then\... Just being there even if they don\'t ask for
    > it\... Or at least being available

-   People who know you suggesting things that they know you need, but
    > only if you want that

SESSION 2

Questions

-   How do you communicate that you don't have capacity?

-   How do "peer support groups" works? What are our experiences of
    > them?

-   What are examples of good support that you have received

Ideas

-   The facilitator needs to not take up too much space... the peers are
    > the ones who can really support each other\...the lived experience

    -   The facilitator can also be a group member and share their lived
        > experience as well

-   Imaginary Object (e.g hat) you take something positive, or something
    > you gained out of and replace with something negative or something
    > you want to let go of

    -   Taking a moment to acknowledge how heavy it is, and how hard the
        > things you're dealing with are.

DEEP CARE

Nocturne 2019

Deep care is taking time to notice when someone is struggling

Deep care is checking in often.

Deep care is making space for challenging emotions

Deep care is valuing and validating someone else\'s experience, even if
it conflicts with your own

Deep care is treating each other\'s needs with respect and kindness.

Nobody teaches you how to do these things, and they\'re REALLY hard to
get right. They take work. They can be uncomfortable. It\'s a subtle
art, and we need more role-models. More examples of groups working
together to create a culture of deep care.

I am going to design 5 "pledges" that audiences can make, and install
"petitions" around the city where folks can sign up and commit to
creating a culture of deep care. An example of a "pledge" might be "I
commit to sitting with uncomfortable emotions when they come up" or "I
commit to asking people in my life how they're doing, and creating space
to hear real answers, even if it's hard for me or makes me
uncomfortable." or "I commit to regularly and explicitly express
gratitude for the people in my life."

Around each pledge there will also be suggestions and instruction on
ways to achieve these goals, e.g. "when you feel an uncomfortable
emotion, you can try: a) take 3 deep breaths, b) acknowledge to yourself
that this is an uncomfortable emotion, and that it's ok to be
uncomfortable sometimes, c) ask yourself why this is making you
uncomfortable" and also warnings around potential dangers e.g. "how to
recognise the difference between discomfort and distress?". We will be
developing these over the months leading up to nocturne, and creating
them into a visual, 3d, sculpture/collage that will be designed in a way
that attaches to trees so that we can install them on the day of
nocturne, and take them down after midnight. If this project is
successful, we will contact the HRM about installing these as a
permanent installation.

Part of this experience is that we'll invite audiences to find all the
pledges, using a scavenger-hunt type format where each of the pledges
has clues about how to find the others, and also a piece of a map that
will unlock a 6th secret location where the "finale" will happen.

The finale will happen at 10:30pm, and will feature a ceremony where
folks come together to affirm each other, and to dance to a recording of
a song that we've been creating called "you are not disposable". This
song is an affirmation that each and everyone one of us is important,
and we are not replaceable. Anyone who's passing by at that time can
experiences this moment, but folks who have signed at least one of the
petitions will experience extra layers of meaning in the lyrics. The
details of the ceremony will be developed over the next few months. [We
will also create and hand out little booklets that summarize some of the
principles behind this project and some of the \"pledges\" that people
can take - see supporting images for an example of previous booklets
we\'ve made]{.mark}

Last year for Nocturne we created a project called "Free Consultations"
that was all about peer support, and it was very successful. We hope to
continue this trend of mental health and peer support related work

Here is a story that inspired my obsession with deep care:

\"I went away for a weekend with some friends, and they were all joking
around and laughing, and nobody noticed that I was having a breakdown.
Of course they didn\'t. I was trying to blend in. I was joking just like
everyone else. Pretending to laugh. Trying to fit in. I didn\'t want to
burden the group with my emotional baggage, so I just held it all in. It
felt so awful. It felt like I was dying. I was suffering and nobody
noticed. I mean, I'm sure at least one person noticed that something was
off, but they didn't do anything about it. The group dynamic was just
going so fast, and nobody felt in control, so it just kept going."

The constantly shifting landscape that we live in creates a deep
instability. It\'s hard to put down roots when everything is changing.
Often we don\'t take the time to ask \"who is falling through the
cracks?\". This project explores how we can create a culture of deep
care as a way to resist the isolation that comes from an ever-changing
world, where not only the city is changing, but the very people that
share their lives with you are in constant flux. Colonialization and
capitalism teaches us to respond to this reality by treating people as
disposable, \"replacing\" them when they no longer fit. Growing up in
this environment we begin to believe that WE are disposable. This tears
apart our networks, our ability to form community, to build anything
long term. Hopefully, by cultivating a culture of deep care we can start
to un-stitch some of these toxic beliefs and start to hold space for
each other in a deep and profound way. Hopefully we can be like the
trees, and grow deep roots, and hold the soil together, even when city
around us is changing.

We will install the pieces starting midday on the day of nocturne. They
should only take a few minutes each as they will be free-standing /
attached in non-destructive ways. We will have plenty of time to
troubleshoot if anything goes wrong. We will de-install after midnight,
and should only take a few minutes at each site.

For the ceremony, we will attach a speaker and lights to the roof of our
car and plug it into our battery system, and park the car in the
\"secret\" location, probably near Victoria park of the public gardens.

Pledges:

I pledge to check in with my friends regularly

I pledge to make time to be present with the people I care about

I pledge to do these things even if it feels uncomfortable at first

I pledge to trust my gut

I pledge that if I notice someone is struggling I will ask them how I
can help

I pledge that if Mother Earth is calling me, I will not ignore her
