When you grow up you can be whatever you want
And you don't have to decide once and for all who you will be
You can change your mind deeply and often
Change everything you are.

Sleep well tonight
Deeply and always
You'll need all the rest you can get
To muster the strength
To shine in this world
And to blow apart all of the smog that's filling the sky

Forget the burning forests
And all of the floods
Just for tonight let yourself rest
Let yourself close your eyes
Just for tonight, let your mind go,
Let your heart rest
Let yourself lie in this lullaby
