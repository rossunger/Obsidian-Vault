It's my body, and you will have to be okay with what
I want cos I won't ever let you tell me what to do

Just because we talked once,
Doesn't mean I owe you
Just because you bought me lunch
Doesn't mean I'm yours

Just because I sexted you
Doesn't mean I want to
Just because we're partners
Doesn't mean I'm yours

Just because we danced close
Doesn't mean you own me
Just because we made out
Doesn't mean I'm yours

Just because you took me home
Doesn't mean we have to
I am not your fucking toy
Your servant, or your master

It's my body, and you will have to be okay with what
I want cos I won't ever let you tell me what to do
