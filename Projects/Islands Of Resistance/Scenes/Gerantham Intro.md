[[Gerantham]] was a tree, at least that\'s how they conceptualised
themselves. A pioneer from the early days of [[chlorophyll technology]],
they may well be the oldest human alive, if you could still call them
that. For over a century, they have stood in the window of the great
city, immobilised, perpetually in a state of photosynthesis. They had
tried to stay abreast of what was going on in the rest of the city by
asking the folks who came to maintain them, but it quickly became
impossible to relate to the human experience, and they had given up
trying to care almost a lifetime ago

Looking over the wasteland that extended forever beyond the city,
Gerantham often felt a deep sadness for all his ancestors who had
perished as the climate had changed. These days this meant the forests
more so than the humans.

It wasn't a bad existence. The sheer joy of photosynthesis was a
beautiful experience that never got old. The one thing Gerantham longed
for was a mycelium to his tree. It was hard to make sense of the world
without being tapped into it. They dreamed of a forest, spanning every
face of the city, connected by a web of tissue. If only they knew how
close their dream was to reality, and how pervertedly the government was
corrupting that dream.

But Gerantham had stopped talking decades ago. They weren\'t even sure
if their vocal cords worked anymore.
