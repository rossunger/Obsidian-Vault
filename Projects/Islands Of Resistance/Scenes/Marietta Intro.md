When she first found out, [[Marietta]] didn't like that [[Zoli]] was hanging
with the revolutionaries. It was dangerous, and she was worried that
they would follow in their father's footsteps. She didn't want to
mourn another unnecessary death. That's part of why she made them work
so much in the store. She thought that maybe if they kept busy they
wouldn't get distracted with knoble causes and foolhardy nonsense.

Marietta had grown up just above the [[blackout line]], and much to the
chagrin of her parents she fell in love with an ambitious do-gooder who
sucked her down the rabbithole and when she smiled as she remembered the passion with which they would stay up late nights, organising, secret
meetings. In some ways, she was excited for Zoli. But as a mother, she was worried. She reminded herself that Zoli was an adult and had to make their own decisions.

Now that Zoli was leaving, she figured maybe it was time to sell the
shop. Maybe she could go stay with her parents. She'd never told Zoli
where she came from. Down here information like that could get you in
ostracized, or worse. She wondered how she would explain everything..
