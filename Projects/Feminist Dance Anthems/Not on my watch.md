Help you out, we'll ask him to leave, we've
Done this all before, and much more, yeah

Unwanted advances and dances are
Not ok, don't play his games, we won't
stand for this ridiculousness, yes
We have got your back

Won't leave you alone, what a bonehead just
Ask for angela at the bar and we'll
Know what's going on yeah what's wrong

Done this all before, and much more, yeah
Life is rough enough as it is, yes
