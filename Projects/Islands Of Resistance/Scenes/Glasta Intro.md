[[Glasta]] rarely meant to be harsh and unfeeling, but for some reason their
attempts at being kind and caring often seemed to devolve into hostile
dumpster fires. Something about their approach to life seemed to rub
people the wrong way, and they often found themselves having to navigate
an unnecessarily complicated tangled web of human relations, regardless
of how promising things seemed at the outset.

As they sat in the [[mediation chamber]] waiting for [[Galoriy]] to cool down
from their latest explosion, Glasta wondered if this was just how life
worked. Maybe it's not their fault that people keep flying off the deep
end with them. Maybe this is just what happens when things get messy.

Glasta couldn't help but remember how sweetly they had got along when
they first met. It was such serendipity to meet another shape-shifter
who was willing to break away from the social norm and partake in the
recreational pastime collaborative problem solving.
