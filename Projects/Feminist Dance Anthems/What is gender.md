I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine

I am not a boy,
I'm not a girl
I'm somewhere in between
And it obscene
That you would need
To know that
Why do you have to know?
Does it change your world?
So why can't you leave me

I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine

Don't be fooled, It's a terrible scene.
Don't become a victim of the gender machine
First you can't be soft. Then you can't be hard.
It chops you up and melts you down, and you come out all scarred

Long hair, short hair, dresses, pants
Gender, organs, sexes, glands
Spit you out and suck you in,
But gender comes from within. gender comes from within gender comes from
within

I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine

I am not a boy,
I'm not a girl
I'm somewhere in between
And it obscene
That you would need
To know that
Why do you have to know?
Does it change your world?
So why can't you leave me

I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
I refuse to be a victim of the gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine, the gender machine
gender machine
