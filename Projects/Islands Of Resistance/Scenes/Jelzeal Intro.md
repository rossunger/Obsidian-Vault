[[Jelzeal]] repeated the [[humility mantra]] to himself as he ascended the final
stairway and took his well-deserved place on the throne at the [[table of planners]]. ![[Humility Mantra]]. It was hard believe that after only 20 years of dedicated service to the [[city planning commission]] he was able to ascend the ranks to become one of the three head planners. As an acolyte of the [[City God]], there could be no higher honour. A lesser devotee would shudder at the responsibility, but Jelzeal's hands were steady, and his visions clear. He would be the bridge between the people and the city.

A rift had been growing. It had been many years since a devotee of the
City God had sat at the table of planners, and Jelzeal believed in his
hearts of hearts that the troubles plaguing the city of late were a
punishment for the leaders' irreverence. Jelzeal wondered what penance
could absolve them of their sins, but alas it was not his place to
question. All he could do was honour the City God by living truthfully
and honorably, humbly, with intentionality.

A newly appointed city god, one of the 3 head city planners. His
decisions affect the lives of many. A life-time dream come true, but a
heavy burden
