How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?

achy, uncomfortable, but grateful none the less
sometimes trapped, but in moments transcendent
impressively expressive, solid yet soft
like many small bananas, ebb and flow of heat and breeze
always healing, but still beloved
sexy but not quite satisfied,

How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?

like bones reconciling flesh
Satisfied, optimistic, braindead
older than I want to be
great, like summing up a thousand year journey
pretty swell, but painful sometimes. Uh.
gorgeous powerful, yet ashamed and weak
curious but unafraid
Sometimes like a hermitcrab
tired yet enthusiastic

Let's close our eyes
and breathe in deep
And feel our body wake us
Up from sleep
I feel your whispers now you're in my ear
I hear your message loud and clear

How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?

I feel it in my hands, I feel it in my toes
I feel in my heart, I feel it in my nose
I feel in my hips, I feel it in my lips,
I feel it in the edges of my fingertips

I feel it in my arms, I feel it in my thighs
I feel it in my nostrils and the back of my eyes
I feel it in my teeth, I feel it in my Chin
I feel it over every single part of my skin

I feel it in my bladder, I feel it in my gum
I feel it through my spinal cord and down to my bum
I feel it in my stomach, I feel it in my lungs
I feel in my eyebrows and the tip of my tongue

How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?
How do you feel do you feel in your body?

    Atm pretty good, a little stiff because I went for a long ride and
    didn't stretch (whoop). Tbh I'm not wearing a sweater for the
    first time in basically all winter and I'm having to re-learn how
    to be okay with people seeing my body without layers of fabric
    over it.\
    Sometimes, like something shit in my soul, or like my heart wants
    to throw up.\
    Sometimes my 'self' and my body are one and everything is easy.\

Where do you feel in your body,

-   my hands

-   my heart

-   my head

-   my fingers

-   my feet

-   my bladder

Tracy Webb-i feel most embodied when I am thinking and/or moving -
whether passively looking out the window, or while walking in woods or
moving powerfully - regardless of mode (walk/run/bike/canoe/ski -
doesn't matter - just the act of moving matters.) Seems funny that it
can be while peacefully quiet and reflective or actively moving
meditation\...also your question - what does it feel like to be in my
body? Hmmm - the energy often overwhelms the physical capability at
times, but my body is pretty game to keep acting like its still 30 years
old. It shakes off the abuses of youth, the breaks and traumas, the
glory of childbirths and healing of miscarriages\...it is such a
forgiving vessel for my spirit. My body feels so strong, alive, so
responsive to being and doing - and my mind can make it go beyond, if I
so decide to push it (wisdom usually kicks in now to say easy does
it\...work up to what you want to do gradually!) I am grateful to my
tiniest molecule that I have the body given to me - and I am sometimes
sad for the times that I wished it would change to match outer
expectations. In my body, I feel blessed, powerful, peaceful - it is
perfectly imperfect for me ❤

Emma-Kate Millar- I love this. I feel embodied when I'm presenting. An
idea, a concept, a movement. When I'm engaging with others.

Sarah Parolin- when I am surrounded by nature I feel truly at home in my
body! Miss you!
