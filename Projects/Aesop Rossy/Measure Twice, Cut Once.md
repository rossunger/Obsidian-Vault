# Measure Twice, Cut Once

Gesturing egregiously for the sacredness you see in me
Desiduously casting destitute demands for lost residuals
Corrupted by those ancient rituals,
Awakening alivening and painfully reminding me
No work is circumvented by pretending it's behind in me

I gather garnered wages
Gouging ghosts through broken gauges,
This engagement is overrated
All the airs are overstated
All the feelings over saturated  

Now we're Lost in withered stagings
Never laid the grounds or pavings
for a conscious peaceful separating
Jumped the gun on trusting
Never testing busted Tensions
Never penetrated false pretensions
Broke the laws of equilibrium
Shoulda been a bit deliberate
Shoulda taken time for trists in woods
tasted bits of fallen twisted goods
Before committing to conceived concessions that left us frozen where we once had stood

They say to measure twice so that you only have to cut once
But I always roll the dice and hope to save the day with wild stunts
