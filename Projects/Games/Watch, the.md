THE WATCH

You control a magical watch that can control the tempo of the world (and
music). It can also go back to a previous time

Some objects are unaffected by time

The Inventor (who invented the watch) keeps popping up at various points
(because he can time travel to older versions of himself) and giving you
either advice or revealing more story.

The Watch can adjust an object's "Resonance" (a musical loop) using its
"Resonator". It can also change the tempo of the world.

Moral of the game: just because something is different, doesn't mean
it's bad.

-   at the start you're trying to make all the sounds harmonious. Later
    > you realise that they already were, you just weren't listening to
    > them right\...

STORY

-   Before "The Watch", all sound was chaos (noise). Enough chaos, and
    > your brains starts to block it out (you have a control that can
    > block out sound). You can make music, but it's only as temporary
    > as the act of making it.

-   When The Inventor created The Watch, humanity rejoiced. They started
    > to make everything sound harmonious permanently. There was a
    > Mysterious Terrorist group that resisted this change calling it
    > unnatural, but they disappeared as mysteriously as they appeared.

-   Eventually everything became so uniform, that "The Uniformity" was
    > noise. Humanity set about trying to fix everything back to the old
    > ways, but it was too late (everything sounded like a variation on
    > The Uniformity). They couldn't remember anything except The
    > Uniformity.

-   The Inventor devised a plan. He revealed to you that The Watch could
    > reverse time if you set it to a negative tempo (your brain would
    > go back to where you were at that time, but with added knowledge).
    > However, no matter how far back you go, humanity always reached
    > the same outcome. They just could not be convinced that The
    > Uniformity was a bad thing until it was too late. And no matter
    > how he tried, he couldn't un-invent The Watch; someone would alway
    > re-invent it. So he would send you back in time to enlist the
    > Mysterious Terrorist Group to record all the original Resonances
    > of every object and hide them until the time was right.

-   Finally

-   A watch appears in your room. You are confused, and after asking

    > Eventually you discover that it was sent back in time to prevent

-   The guy who invented "The Watch" sends it back in time and gives you

    > it to control all

-   Characters teach you songs.
