Queer enough,
I'm queer enough,
You're queer enough
We're queer enough

It's not a secret club. There are no secret rules
There is no special way to be that you never learnt in school

Queer enough,
I'm queer enough,
You're queer enough
We're queer enough

You can talk talk talk however you like
You can wear wear wear whatever feels good
They keep try'na tell you what what'you gotta be
But you and me, we gotta stand up to "should"

Gender is a social construct
So it's sexuality
Close your eyes and shake your limbs
If you feel the same as me

Queer enough,
I'm queer enough,
You're queer enough
We're queer enough

You don't have to be flamboyant. You don't have to be unique.
You don't have to redesign yourself or the way you speak
And if you hear that voice in your head, and you feel like you don't
belong
Then you've got crooked cops in your head and you gotta gotta stay
strong
