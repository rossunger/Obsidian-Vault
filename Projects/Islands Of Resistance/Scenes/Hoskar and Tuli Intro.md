[[Hoskar]] and [[Tuli]] had run their small [[museum]] together for 21 years. Everyone who visited thought they were the cutest little elderly couple, which is probably the reason they were able to sell so much merchandise.
They were earning enough to move the entire operation up a few levels, but this museum had been in Tuli's family for 7 generations, and she wasn't prepared to leave it behind. In fact there was an old family motto that she never understood that her mother would repeat whenever she talked about leaving. "the museum holds the keys to the city, and we must hold the keys to the museum."

In her childhood Tuli had played many games with her parents which
growing up she realised were designed to teach her rituals, with sacred
objects and chanted mantras. There was a lot of mythology surrounding
this museum. They said it was created by one of the 4 founding fathers
of Q, but she wasn't sure whether it was Luxford or Jonas.

She didn't really know what any of it meant or why it was so important,
which is probably why she only half-life heartedly related it all to [[Marietta]] growing up. She was a little sad about it now, imagining the museum shutting down, but she had no other kids, and Marietta had left this life behind. She briefly considered selling it, but the superstitions felt too ominous to ignore.

As she wandered the [[Lisgard]] and [[Tennerman]] exhibits she wondered again
how this all started. Did someone just sit down one day and make up a bunch of myths and superstitions? Or did they build up gradually? Was
she supposed to add to the Canon? And of course there was that thought
that sent tingles up her spine that felt so right but couldn't possibly be true: what if it was all real? What if this museum really was a temple that held all the secrets of the city? She had always assumed that it was a metaphor, but something in her stirred at the thought that might really be a descendant of the great [[Luxford]] or [[Jonas]], both!

She looked at the plaques as she walked past them: "175 years ago, the
great Lisgard wrote the white paper that definitely predicted crucial
elements of the [[climate apocalypse]]. In the years that followed, as the
predictions started coming true, #todo =insert description of predictions= and the warning signs exploded beyond a doubt, a movement developed. Lisgard was approached by a very talented young individual who has a different vision for the future."

A school group was passing through the next chamber, and a sweet voice
read out the text: "Tennerman was a young college graduate with a big
head and a brain to match. They were an engineer, and an architect, with
a big picture plan that would save humanity from impending doom"

...a school group comes through with =Angelo's wife as teacher and a kid
character?

...Their museum is generations old, and actually contains the secrets to
the tech, which were supposed to be for the people, but was buried by
the corporations so that they could profit

...tuli is dying, wonders who will look after the museum when she's gone

...they meet their grandkid [[Zoli]] who is trying to find the secrets
