![[The Baker and his friend.m4a]]
Pestering the Jester with vague requests for breaking bread, 
the Baker, half impressed by tender tendencies, 
fights slander with a slender gratitude directed at his long lost friend 
in hopes that maybe in the finite future 
facts emerge and culminate in a constellation that's allowing them 
to once again butt heads, hold hands, to one another understand, 
and granted maybe now the moment's passed and the timeline's ended, not every broken promise poorly brokered's destined to be mended
