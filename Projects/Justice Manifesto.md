We come together for the greater good of our community, to support the transformations necessary for peace and prosperity. Our objectives, in order of priority are:
- A halting of ongoing harm
- A feeling of genuine and realistic hope for everyone involved.
- A sense of community, belonging and appreciation for everyone involved.
- A sense of peace and wellness for everyone involved.

Our strategies for reaching our objectives include:
- Brainstorming and creating conditions where individuals are able to take space as needed, and the de-escalation of urgency
- Communicating with all parties as needed to understand what has happened and why, without judgement or pressure for action.
- Inviting healers and facilitators to brainstorm pathways to peace, and supporting everyone involved in walking the red road.
- Planning community events conscientiously, to support all parties involved
- Forming committees and creating policies and guidelines as an offering for anyone in the community struggling to navigate tensions or complicated dynamics.

With the intention to seek justice, we strive to:
- Do no harm
- Take our time
- Accept that there are things we cannot change
- Develop faith in the process
- Validate the importance and significance of our efforts.
- Seek support when it is needed.
- Hold space for all emotions and expressions to the best of our ability.
- Create containers for positive transformation
- Approach things that seem problematic with scrutiny, but not prejudice.

We identify and acknowledge the following demons (or potential pitfalls):
- the weaponization of words resulting in lateral violence. 
  E.g. "harm", "abuse", "gaslighting", "spiritual-bypassing", "racism", "homophobia".  
- the obfuscation of authenticity in the shadow of optics; 
  i.e. worrying about what others might think / how something might look/read
- the fanatical belief that there is only one version of reality
- the intellectualisation of memory
- the inexplicable confidence in one's unfaltering ability to interpret what ones body is saying
- The illusion of urgency
- The corruption of black and white thinking.

We accept the following truths:
- We support justice of our own volition, as an act of service.
- The wellbeing of a community is the shared responsibility of everyone in the community, and not any one individual
- We exist in a colonial patriarchal context, and as such there may be times when our capacity is limited, or our values must face internal conflicts.
- "Community" is an abstract concept.
- Genuine faith is a product of lived experience, and as such takes time, and cannot be fabricated or scheduled.
- Understanding of words is subjective and language is a fundamentally flawed method of communication. Words and meanings evolve over time, and are understood differently by each person.
- There are things that we DO not, and CAN not understand.
