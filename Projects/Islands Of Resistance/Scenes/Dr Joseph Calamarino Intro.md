As doctor [[Dr Joseph Calamarino|Joseph Calamarino]] washed the blood off his hands he pondered
what had gone wrong. They had often been called a sociopath, but they couldn't really understand why. They weren't trying to hurt anyone. They  were upfront about the risks associated with the procedure. Nobody down here does anything like this. They had read every resource they could find on the topic. They weren't intentionally causing harm.

Joseph triple checked all the data. The blood types matched. The antibodies seemed to react as expected. There were no traces of infection. It just didn't make sense. This was the third one to reject the procedure. If he could just figure this out, he could really make a difference in people's  lives. That's what people didn't get. He was just trying to make a difference. A few ruined lives to save thousands? Totally worth it.

Doctor Calimarino thought of the freezer dinner that awaited him when he
got home and wondered why he couldn't figure out how to make friends
anymore. Maybe it was his age? Or money? Joseph was considerably wealthy for someone living on the lower levels, in fact he could probably afford to live high enough to be above the [[blackout line]] and maybe own a
[[suncave]] of his own, but something compelled him to remain down here.

Joseph had made his small fortune by running venues. He had a knack for
numbers and a distinct disinterest in aesthetic that allowed him to hand
creative control to others, and he happened to get incredibly lucky with
his first selection.

It wasn't his intention to create the most infamous queer venue in the
entire city, but his lack of prejudice and relative ignorance of the
politics of the time meant that he took a chance on the most unlikely
people. The venue quickly attracted liberal thinkers and
revolutionaries, and, eventually, a wealthy patron who refused to share
their identity. However, secrets don't last very long down here, and
the masses soon started calling it "[[The Quinn]]" after the [[Prince of Q]]
himself.
