## Opening

*Washington Square Park. Middle of the night. As each character finishes their verse, they go to sleep.*

**X1:** 
>~Spare some change, spare a quarter,
>~Don't you know I'm somebody's daughter
>~You say get a job, what's your problem,

>~Have you tried to get a job
>~Without the proper ID?
>
>~Hurry by, drop a coin
>~God forbid you should smile

**X2:** 
> ~Spare some change, spare a Lincoln,
> ~Sure, I mean, yeah, I've been drinkin',
> ~What's the difference How I spend it?
> ~I still need what I need
> 
> ~What am I supposed to do
> ~When each morning I'm fighting the shakes
> ~What am I supposed to do
> ~When I'm dealing with these splitting headaches
>
> ~Live like me, come and try it
> ~You don't know nothing until you do

**X3:** 
> ~Spare some change, hey! I'm trying
> ~Would you care more if I were crying?
> ~What did I ever do to deserve this?
> ~You never bother to ask
>
> ~Look away pretend you don't see me

**X4:** 
>~You see me lurking, you cross the street

# **SCENE X**

*Washington Sq Park wakes up. Tommy wheels out his piano. Other performers wheel out their instruments. We see chorus interact*

**Chorus:** 
>~Oh washington square
>~Thanks for being my home
>~Thanks for saving my life
>~Without you we'd be lost

*The buskers start. Tommy bring Pastor Jerry a beer. Jerry is incredibly grateful*

**Jerry:** 
>Thank you Tommy, god bless.

**Tommy:** 
>You're welcome

**Jerry:** 
>I'll pay you back, I promise

**Tommy:** 
>We've all been there

**Jerry:** 
>I'm down to 10 a day. It's just to stop my hands from shaking, ya know

**Tommy:** 
>What time's your sermon today? We've got Celine on the piano until 3, but you can play til 9 or ten if you help me wheel her back?

**Jerry:** 
>That should work. Thanks Tommy.

**Tommy:** 
>Where's Jaz?

*Everyone looks around. Jaz pops out of a bush. Everyone is relieved.*

**Tommy:** 
>How are ya doin' today Jaz?

**Jaz:** 
>Oh I'm fine thanks, Tommy. They're a bit worried, but I'm gonna try to calm
> them down. They don't like all these changes. Things keep changing.
> changing.

**Tommy:** 
> You let me know if you need anything, alright? I'll be around.

*Jaz walks off muttering. Tommy starts giving a tour to the audience*

**Tommy:** 
>Ladies and gentlemen, non-binary folk, tourists, patrons. You have just set foot in one of the greatest, most influential parks of all time. This park has had a long, brutal history of injustice. This used to be an indigenous burial ground, and when the Dutch seized the land, this area was deemed so undesirable, that they freed some of their slaves from Africa and made them into heavily taxed farmers. Later, when the English stole this land from the Dutch, they massacred the freed slaves and over time turned this land into a potter's field. That means a mass grave for people who weren't wealthy enough or important enough to deserve their own grave. Well, as New York urban sprawled down the isle of Manhattan, this land developed the potential to be prime real-estate, so what did they do? They put a park here. Land value soared; The rich moved in, and the poor? They were bought out
>and kicked to the curb. No biggie right? Well, as Manhattan started filling up and overflowing into the nearby burrows, something wonderful happened. Those of us who were lost, bullied out of our own neighbourhoods, we found our voice

>~running protests in Washington Square.

*Chorus join in*

**Chorus:** 
>~Washington Sq, Washington sq
>~Park of the people where everyone cares
>~They care for what's just
>~They care for the earth
>~They care for their rights
>~They care for people who sleep here at night

**Tommy:** Pretty quickly it became our home. This bench was my first
sleeping place

> back in the 60s.

**Tourist:** You lived here?

**Tommy:** These benches have seen a lot of action over the years. Young
lovers,

> business people, even Bob Dylan once. We were part of a community. A
> community that looked out for each other. For years the parks
> department and local governments have been trying to get rid of us
> with their bylaws and regulations, but the community has stood strong
> and rallied behind us. They really made us feel

**Tommy:** Welcome in washington square.

**Chorus:** Washington Sq, Washington sq

> Park of the people where everyone shares
>
> They share what they can
>
> They share what they think
>
> They share what they wrote
>
> They share what the leaders don't want you to know

*Tommy is giving a tour*

**Tommy:** ...and this is the infamous Hangman's Elm. It happens to be
the oldest known

> tree in Manhattan. Currently, the parks department's plan is to tear
> it down as part of renovations.

**Tourist:** When are we getting to the fountain?

> *Enter Dan. On phone.*

**Dan:** Mum, You haven't seen the guy in 20 years, what if he's a
nutjob?

*Tommy's tour walk into Dan.*

**Tommy:** And here we have the famous chess boards. For a small tip,
these fellas will

> give you a game to remember. Lars has been doing this for 18 years
> now. Good friend of mine.
>
> Sir, would you like to join the save-washington-square-park tour?

**Dan:** Sorry, I'm busy.

**Tommy:** It's only 15 minutes long

**Dan:** Hold on mum

> (to tommy) I'm on the phone
>
> (to mum) It's just a homeless man giving a tour. There's a lot of
> homeless people here.

**Tommy:** Suit yourself.

> This here is where I first met Billy Joel. He was hard up and needed
> somewhere to stay

**Dan:** I don't mean to be rude, but I just can't imagine Billy Joel
being "hard up"

**Tommy:** You'd be surprised. I've lived in this park for many years,
I've seen it all

**Dan:** I just can't see it. He's made so much money. Why would he be
sleeping in

> a park?

**Tommy:** Do you consider yourself a Billy Joel expert?

**Dan:** Sorry, I don't have time for this. I've gotta go to work

**Tommy:** You don't need to be an asshole.

**Dan:** I didn't mean it like that

> *Tommy and the tour move on*

**Dan:** Fine I'll give him a call if I'm in trouble. I'll be fine mum.
You have nothing to

> worry about. I have the savings account. If the apartment doesn't work
> out I'll just stay in a hotel until I find something. Just enjoy your
> trip. I'll see you at christmas.
>
> SONG

**Dan:** Ever since I was a kid

> Daddy always used to say
>
> You gotta earn your keep
>
> Cos all you're worth is what you work
>
> So I tried to get a job
>
> The moment I became a teen
>
> But all they wanted to pay me was minimum wage
>
> I guess I always wanted more
>
> I wasn't made for mopping floors
> I'm halfway through my 7 years of Law
> And now I'm so much more
>
> I finally made it to new york city
>
> Everybody gets what they deserve and I worked hard so now I'm getting
> what I'm worth
>
> Everybody gets what they deserve and I worked hard so now I'm getting
> what I'm worth
>
> *Dan is at a coffee shop*

**Coffee:** Would you like whipped cream with that?

**Dan:** Yeah, why not. I deserve it

**Coffee:** Would you like to purchase a suspended coffee?

**Dan:** What's that?

**Coffee:** It's where you pay for an extra coffee, so that someone in
need can have one

> for free

**Dan:** Huh. What a great idea. Not today, thanks.

> *Dan uses his card to pay. It is declined. Twice. He finds cash in his
> pocket but is concerned.*

**Dan:** Declined? Your machine must be broken. Here, I've got cash

> *Dan meets George.*

**George:** Daniel! Welcome to the parks department. We have some very
exciting

> plans. What's with the suitcase?

**Dan:** I just got in

**George:** Keen Bean! Just got in and straight to work! I like that.
Walk with me

**Dan:** Oka-

**George:** If you're going to be my intern, there's 3 things you need
to know about

> me: I can't stand when people lose things, I expect you to be
> punctual, and you've always gotta look professional. Are we gonna have
> any problems?

**Dan:** No sir.

**George:** Good. Now, if you're gonna be working on the washington
square project you

> really need to see the state of affairs.

**Dan:** Grea-

**George:** This park has so much potential but it's got some
fundamental problems.

> *They encounter Jerry, drunk and asleep. George steps over him. Dan
> walks around.*
>
> SONG

**George:** There's a plague that has begun,

> And this park's been overrun.
>
> There's really nowhere I can turn without a grizzly face that's
> hustling me for coin
>
> They call it the park of the people
>
> Well, aren't I people?
>
> So why can't it cater to me
> And the brilliant visions that I see
>
> I can see it in my mind
>
> All the structures are aligned
>
> And the grass is sprouting greener
>
> And the tourists eat their Wiener's
>
> And the buskers never play the same song twice
>
> Little kids in fountain, wading
>
> And the graduates parading
>
> And the childhood sweethearts on their very first date
>
> If only I could quash this epidemic
> But the problem is systemic
>
> So we'll have to redesign the park
>
> *George hands a bunch of posters to Dan who is confused, but starts
> putting them up anyway.*

**George:** For the people.

> I'll see you tomorrow.
>
> *George goes home for the day. Dan awkwardly walks around with his
> suitcase, putting up posters*

**Tommy: ...**And here we have the famous arch and fountain. This is
the heart of

> Washington Square. This plaza has seen countless crucial protests. If
> you wanna make a difference, this is the place to do it. And huge
> shocker, the parks department wants take the fountain apart. Make sure
> you take lots of photos; we don't how long it's gonna be around.
> 
> Fun fact, if you're here on a weekend you'll hear my good friend
> Colin. He's here with his grand piano under the arch, that's right, a
> GRAND piano. make sure to leave him a tip.
>
> *Dan receives a call.*

**Dan:** Hello?

**Phone:** Hi. Dan? I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but we've
got bedbugs.

**Dan:** Bed bugs? You're joking?

**Phone:** I know you've already payed for the month in advance, and I
just want

> you to know, I feel so bad about this, I'm gonna refund you half your
> rent

**Dan:** HALF my rent? Look, I don't know anyone in new york, can you at
least help

> me find a place to stay tonight

**Phone:** I'm sorry.

> *They hang up*

**Dan:** Fuck.

> *Tommy finishes giving a tour.*

**Tommy:** Thank you for taking the washington square park community
tour. If you liked

> what you heard, please donate to the Save-Washington-Square
> foundation, and go online to sign the petition! I don't get paid for
> this, I am a volunteer. If you'd like to put some money in this jar,
> it does go towards paying my rent. Thank you

*Tourist give Tommy money and thank him.*

**Tourist:** You're not still sleepin' on that bench, are ya Darlin'?

**Tommy:** No, I have somewhere to stay now.

**Tourist:** Well, you take care now.

> *Tommy looks at a poster*

**Tommy:** Redesigning the park, again? Why can't they just leave it be?

*Dan calls Tommy.*

**Tommy:** Hello?

**Dan:** Hi. Is this Tommy?

**Tommy:** Speaking

**Dan:** This is Dan. My parents are Don and Gina Makowski. I think you
might be my

> uncle? I'm in New York, and they said I could call you if I needed
> anything

**Tommy:** Sure thing. Anything I can do to help.

**Dan:** Do you wanna maybe meet up? I'm just in washington square park.
Under the

> arch. You know where that is?
>
> *Tommy looks around and sees who Dan is.*

**Tommy:** Yah I think I can find it. I'll be over in a bit.

> *They hang up. Tommy scrunches up the poster and throws it away.*

*Tommy heads over to Dan.*

**Dan:** Not you again. I told you, I don't want to go on your tour man.

**Tommy:** Do you need a hand?

**Dan:** I'm just having the worst day. Have you had ever had everything
go wrong all

> at once? Oh. Sorry. Look, here's a dollar, now would you leave me
> alone?
>
> *Pause*

**Tommy:** Suit yourself

> *Tommy is offended and leaves*

*Dan waits for "Tommy". Calls the bank.*

**Dan:** Hi my name is Dan Makowski, I just tried using my bank card and
it was

> declined but there's lots of money in the account. Sure my pin's 5477.
> Yes I'll hold. What do you mean my bank account has been frozen?! I
> need that money- I just moved to new york. Can I talk to a manger?
> What am I supposed to do? I don't know anyone here!
>
> This can't be happening
>
> *While he's distracted, Dan's suitcase is stolen. When he notices, he
> is mortified. He counts his cash*

**Dan:** That's not even enough for a hotel. Ok. Think Dan, What're your
options.

> Sleep at the office; I could get fired if they catch me, and it's
> probably locked. Keep waiting for Tommy; but what if he NEVER shows
> up. Think think think. You don't know anyone in the city, your money's
> tied up, you could...go to a bar and try to pick up a girl. HA. That
> only works in the movies. Godamnit. Why didn't I take out more cash.
> How did I not plan for this. I need a drink
>
> *Jerry offers him his beer.*

**Dan:** No thanks

**SCENE X**

> *Dan goes to a bar. Tries to call Tommy again.*
>
> *[DANCE NUMBER]{.underline}*
>
> *A girl sits next to him and flirts. He gets her number, but she
> leaves. Dan keeps trying to pick up so that he has somewhere to stay.
> Finally, he finds a girl who takes him to her house*
>
> *Dan discovers she's married.*

**Dan:** You're married?

**Girl:** It's ok. He's away for the weekend.

> *Dan is anxious. Normally he'd just leave, but he needs somewhere to
> sleep. He tries to avoid having sex with her but she is very
> persistent. Finally, she passes out and he tries to get some sleep. He
> hears memories*

**Dan V/O**: Don't worry mum, I've got the savings account...

What if he's a nutbag...

Do you wanna meet up? I'm in washington square, under the arch-

> *Suddenly, the door slams; her husband is home.*
>
> Dan is scared. He tries to hide, then realises how guilty that will
> look. He starts to get dressed.
>
> *Enter husband*

**Dan:** It's not what it looks like!

> *Dan is terrified. The husband is Jealous and Furious. It doesn't end
> well.*
>
> *In his hurry to leave, Dan forgets his phone and wallet behind.*

**Dan:** Oh no. This can't be happening.

> That's all my ID. And my phone! Oh no no no. This is not happening.
> What am I supposed to do?
>
> *Dan walks through washington square. He doesn't know what to do, who
> to turn to.*
>
> *[DANCE NUMBER]{.underline}*
>
> *Nightmare sequence.*
>
> *He breaks down and cries. Eventually falls asleep*

**SCENE X**

> *Morning. Tommy finds Dan curled up in the park.*

**Tommy:** You alright, son?

**Dan:** I'm fine. Must've fallen asleep

**Tommy:** Do you need a hand?

**Dan:** I said I'm fine

**Tommy:** Oh I get it. You're a 'fiercely independent' kinda guy? or
are you scared that

> people might think we're friends?

**Dan:** No, it's not that-
I gotta go.

> *[DANCE NUMBER]{.underline}*
>
> *On his lunch break, Dan tries to get his wallet back. Can't remember
> exactly where she lives. All the buildings look too similar. He feels
> Determination, Hope, then Foreboding, then the Heart Drop moment, then
> Disbelief, Despair, Self-loathing. He resolves to keep truckin'.*
>
> *Dan tries to call someone, doesn't know any numbers. Frustration,
> Self loathing.*

*Dan goes to the library to look up some resources. Impatience,
Frustration.*

**Librarian:** You need a library card to use the computers

**Dan:** Can I get a library card?

**Librarian:** Sure. I'm just going need some ID?

**Dan:** I don't have any

**Librarian:** Just like a driver's license, or student card

**Dan:** I lost my wallet.

**Librarian:** Just give me an address

**Dan:** I don't-

*Dan sees a government brochure which has the locations of police
departments*

**Dan:** Nevermind.

> How do I get to the west 10th street police precinct?
>
> *Bureaucrats with "red tape" stop Dan from getting what he needs as he
> goes to Police Department, the DMV, and tries to get emergency
> assistance without any documents. Red Tape dance. Shock. Feeling
> Insulted. Fighting, resisting, fury, exhaustion. Collapse.*

**Police:** Sorry we can't help you. Try the DMV?

**DMV:** You need 3 people to vouch for you, and

**Welfare:** You need a social security number

**Dan:** I don't have any of those

**X:** Maybe you should get a job.

> *Dan drops off resumes. A slew of business owners turning their back
> on him as he applies for a job*

**X:** Sorry

**X:** We're not hiring

**X:** (rude smile)

**X:** Just drop off a resume

> *Dan returns to the office from his lunch break, defeated.*

**George:** Dan. I tried calling you. What's with your phone, it goes
straight to voicemail.

**Dan:** I must've been on the subway.

> *Dan realises* *he might not have anywhere to stay for a while. Thinks
> of shelters. Dread, Fear, Manic Thoughts, Forlorn.*
>
> *Dan goes to a shelter. Sees someone shooting up / finds a needle in
> his bed. Sees 2 people get into a fight over the TV channel. One of
> them bites the other. A creepy guy, who keeps itching himself wants to
> have a conversation.*

**Shelter:** You got any smokes?

> *Starts looking through Dan's coat.*

**Shelter:** Can you even hear me?

*Dan freaks out and runs away.*

> *MEANWHILE, Simultaneously, between 'bits' of the montage, Tommy
> protests in the fountain.*

**Tommy:** Your time is running out. You look around, and nothing is
familiar. Things are

> changing faster than we could possibly have imagined. When did things
> get so bad? Do you remember signing YOUR life away? I don't. I believe
> in a free America. I believe in democracy. I believe that each human
> deserves a vote. And that each individual should be able to make a
> difference. But that is not the case. This government is letting us
> down. The bipartisan system is not working.

**Tommy:** The state of the world is grim, it's a ticking time-bomb

> The system is sick, and this park is a symptom
>
> They're bailing out banks and forgiving the rich
>
> We're drowning head-deep in Corruption and privilege
>
> Racist, supremacists, fundamentally anti-**fem**inist,
>
> Their con**fede**rate's rhetoric blinds you to who really benefits
>
> From their trojan horse policy, yeah, their words full of fallacy
>
> Their rationale full of holes you see they're a walking hypocrisy

**Tommy:** Yeah, all this **pow**er's a **fic**kle thing

> And the corruption is trick-a-ling
>
> Down to local authorities
>
> With their fucked up priorities
>
> With their warped seniority
>
> Beating up on minorities
>
> Now even NYC parks select
>
> Delusional architects
>
> There's project wide disconnect
>
> Communities feel neglect
>
> With all this surveillance
>
> Justifying their spying, decrying us
>
> fundamentally violent
>
> and they're silencing people who need all the help they can get
>
> They're delaying repaying this societal debt

**Tommy:** They come to the park, rearrange public property

> They wanna level the plaza, that don't sound right to me
>
> They're chopping **her**itage trees
>
> With all their false expertise
>
> And all their bullshit degrees
>
> Bringing folks to their knees
> Unnecessarily squeezing out
>
> The people who've been here for generations we've lived here;
> 
> It's obscene how routinely they ignore what we need here
>
> We've been pro**test**ing for months and still they stick with their
> guns
>
> This doesn't feel like democracy
>
> And if you're tired and fired up, let's put an end to this mockery
>
> Drop a beat, and repeat after me:
>
> We want our park back.

**Chorus:** We want our park back

**Tommy:** We want our park back.

**Chorus:** We want our park back

**George:** You don't know what you're talking about.

**Tommy:** Finally! A representative from the Parks department meeting
us on our turf.

**George:** Now, I can't rhyme or rap the way you do, but I can
definitely tell you,

> No-one's being removed. And it would sincerely behoove you to realise
> that we're just making slight alterations.
> Just slight modifications

**Chorus:** Ooooo

**George**: What?

> No more cracks in the infrastructure. More grass. It's all good stuff
> for sure.
> Everything we're doing is opening up new opportunities. It's all for
> the greater good of the wider community.

**Chorus:** Oooo

**George:** What? Why are you Ooo-ing. Oh, I didn't mean to rhyme. I
didn't! I don't have

> time for this! Damn!

**Chorus:** Ooooo.

**George:** Bottom line, I care about this park, and I care about the
community and

> we're going to do everything we can to ensure that the heritage of
> this park is not lost

**Chorus:** Bullshit!

**Tommy:** It must be nice, George

> Sitting in your swanky office sketching parks
>
> Prancing around in your Armani suit and tie
>
> Making a fuss; pretend you care about us

But when push comes to shove you throw us under the bus

> *The chorus taunt George, but he resists "stooping to their level"*

**Chorus:** Buuuuurn

> *Finally he gives in and joins the rap battle.*

**George:** It must be nice

> Sitting around in the sun all day
>
> Running around having fun all day
>
> Collecting your welfare off the tax we pay.
>
> While all us honest folk are working overtime
>
> You say you're broke, and yet I bet you're better off than I am
>
> I bet you don't have credit or even owe a dime
>
> But unlike some of you I have to pay for rent
>
> I'm sorry that I can't just go and pitch a tent
>
> Float around engaging in socialist dissent
>
> So maybe take a look at your misplaced discontent
>
> *The chorus is insulted.*

**Chorus:** (silence)

**George:** What?! What are you all looking at?

> *Privilege Song*

**Chorus:** Let me tell you a story of Georgie and Ty

> Georgie's got parents who are doing just fine
>
> Ty got mum and daddy
>
> Working overtime
>
> And often they'll come home and fight
>
> While Georgie in the suburbs goes to private school
>
> Ty is in the ghetto tryna learn the rules
>
> Of how to stay alive
>
> Cos when you live in the dives
>
> Not getting stabbed is a constant concern
>
> You gotta check yourself, you've had privilege
>
> You gotta check yourself, you've had privilege
>
> You're a man, you're white,
>
> You've never been in a fight
>
> Your definition of broke is what makes you rich
>
> Time to go to college, Ty has had to defer, [he can't afford it]
>
> Georgie's got Daddy putting in a good word [of course he get's the
> job]
>
> It's hardly fair that you'd compare the two
>
> Of course you probably think they deserve it
>
> So when you've gone through life with privilege coming out your ears
>
> You've got a fancy house and a nice career
>
> I'm sure it's easy to think that somehow you worked harder
>
> And that makes you better than we are

> You gotta check yourself, you've had privilege
>
> You gotta check yourself, you've had privilege
>
> You're a man, you're white,
>
> You've never been in a fight

> Your definition of broke is what makes you rich

**George:** Ugh!

> *George leaves in a huff.*
>
> *Pastor Jerry arrives and hands out free dumpstered pizza. Dan
> hesitantly approaches.*

**Dan:** Is this some sort of charity program?

**Jerry:** Have a slice

**Dan:** Thank you so much.

> *Dan tries a piece. It's cold, and tastes funny*

**Dan:** Oh. It's cold. Where did you get this?

**Jerry:** The dumpster outside Arturo's.

> *Dan almost spits it out. He feels sick that he ate most of a piece.*
>
> *Jerry runs a little sermon.*

**Jerry:** Today we celebrate perseverance. It is no secret that I've
been struggling

> with addiction. When I first came to this park, I was drinking 16
> beers a day. And that's just to stop my hands from shaking. Today I'm
> proud to say that I am down to 9! Thanks to the kindness and support
> of those closest to me, I am able to keep my demons at bay as I work
> towards a sober life. Now if you'd like to join me in a prayer.
>
> *Foreshadow Jerry's song*
>
> Amen.
>
> *Enter Tommy with a six pack. He gives one to Jerry.*

**Jerry:** Thanks Tommy.

> *Dan looks at Jerry judgmentally. Jerry responds.*
>
> *Tommy offers Dan a beer*

**Tommy:** Beer?

**Dan:** No thanks.

**Tommy:** Not even one.

**Dan:** Alright

> *Dan takes it. Jerry looks at Dan judgmentally. Dan responds.*

**Jerry:** I wouldn't start now, if I were you

**Dan:** It's just a beer

**Jerry:** it's never just one

> *Dan turns away, wanting to be alone. Jerry sings anyway*
>
> Song: Jerry's song

**Jerry:** (tells his story)

> I was living the dream. I had a devoted congregation, a beautiful
> family, white picket fence, all that crap, except it wasn't me. I had
> everything I'd never dreamed of. I resented everyone around me, but I
> kept telling myself, just give it one more year
>
> One more lie
>
> One more angry outburst
>
> One more beer
>
> And I'd look in the mirror and I hate what I see
>
> *Feeling trapped drives you do crazy things*
>
> And I know that I shouldn't but the devil in me says
>
> Have a little drink, man, just one
>
> No one's gonna find out
>
> You deserve a break, man
>
> You've gone long enough without
>
> And I know that I shouldn't cos I promised them no, but I'm losing my

>
> And the devil keeps harping, and my throat is dry,
>
> I'm on a speeding train to hell
>
> Cos it's never just one.
>
> *Dan is still trying to ignore Jerry.*

**Jerry:** Having a kid to save the marriage was a mistake. Having two
was idiotic. I

> love my family, but I should have walked away years ago. Every day I'd
> come home, the kids are running around like crazy, and their mom is
> always nagging me nagging me nagging me
>
> One more lie
>
> One more year
>
> Just one more torrid love affair

**Dan:** I thought you were married?

**Jerry:** The church is a beast of it's own. A vampire, feeding me,
feeding me, feeding

**Dan:** So you were lying and cheating, they found you out, and now
you're on the

**Jerry:** Hey! That's cruel. I'm trying.

**Dan:** I just feel bad for your family

**Jerry:** Yeah, me too.

> *Dan looks at the empty Pizza boxes*

**Dan:** Can I have these?

**Jerry:** Sure

**SCENE X**

**Dan:** I can't believe I'm doing this. There's something wrong with
this image. This is

**Dan:** That's what homeless look likes

**Police:** We're gonna have to ask you to move

**Dan:** Really?

**Tommy:** I've got this

**Dan:** I don't need your help.

**Tommy:** He's just having a moment

**Dan:** No I'm not.

**Tommy:** He's with me

**Dan:** I'm not a fucking hobo!

**Tommy:** I'll take care of this

**Police:** He's all yours.

> *The police leave, grateful they don't have to deal with Dan.*

**Tommy:** Sit down

> *Dan sits, shocked.*

**Tommy:** You've been a real prick to me. You look down on me like you
think you're

**X:** You look at me and all you see is my addiction

**X:** You see me busk and you discuss "what's his affliction"

**X:** But if you stopped and talked to me you see I'm so much more
than this

> Mediocre homeless character that you deplore

**Chorus:** Cos I'm a person. I am still a human being.

> If you look beyond
>
> My tattered rags
>
> You'll see that I am real

**X:** I use hard drugs and hang with thugs, but I'm a person

**X:** I hear voices talk,

**X:** and I wear a frock,

**X+X:** but I'm a person

**X:** If only you could see me for the brilliance that's inside

> Maybe you would finally take the time to put your differences aside

**Chorus:** Cos I'm a person, just like you in every way,

> Yeah my body aches
>
> And I make mistakes
>
> But I'm full of hopes and dreams

**Dan:** What did I ever do to deserve such kindness from a stranger in
his place

> He did nothing to deserve me
>
> So why was I shoved in his face

> Why did I assume that he was homeless

> And why did that translate to being mean

> Mother always said watch out they'll hurt you

> No dad, you don't just get what you deserve

> *Tommy has been watching. Dan is startled.*

**Dan:** I'm sorry-

**Tommy:** Save it. I heard ya the first time. Your parents did a real
number on ya. They

**Dan:** You knew my parents? You-

> You're Tommy?!

**Tommy:** Yep.

**Dan:** I was supposed to-

> Sorry-

> Thank you-

> Fuck you! I waited all night! You could have said something.

> I deserved it didn't I.

> Oh man.

**Tommy:** Relax kid. It's alright.

> *Pause.*

**Dan:** I guess this means we're family?

**Tommy:** Yep.

**Dan:** Uncle Tommy

**Tommy:** Just Tommy.

**Dan:** You're so not how I imagined you.

**Tommy:** How did you imagine me?

**Dan:** More like my parents, I guess. I can see why they never talked
about you

**Tommy:** Ha! I haven't seen your dad since before I left for college.

**Dan:** You went to college?

**Tommy:** Yep. Four years of political science.

**Dan:** So how come you lived on the streets?

**Tommy:** I couldn't afford rent AND tuition, so I chose tuition. Now,
even though I have

> a place to stay, this feels like home. There's something beautiful
> about living off the grid. No-one can find you unless they know where
> to look. Jaz, over there, is almost completely off grid. She's

**Dan:** Isn't she a little (cuckoo)?

**Tommy:** Jaz is highly functioning. She hears voices, but she knows
it, and she handles

> it real well.

**Dan:** Huh.

**Tommy:** She's probably the most well put-together of all of us.
Nothing phases her.

**Dan:** P.s. Sorry if I was an asshole during your tour.

**Tommy:** Ah, they're a tough crowd anyway. I'm used to it.

**Dan:** How long have you been giving tours?

**Tommy:** A few years now. Ever since I took that history course at
NYU, I've just been

> fascinated with this park. I figured giving tours is a good way to get
> people signing our petition and fundraising so that we can keep
> fighting this redesign, and, the history here is mind boggling. This
> park is seriously haunted.

**Dan:** What, like ghosts?

**Tommy:** Yeah. The amount of people buried here: it's bone chilling. I
see them in my

> sleep.

**Dan:** Quit messing with me.

**Tommy:** I'm not kidding.

> *Long Pause. Dan is on edge.*

**Dan:** So, can I stay at your place?

**Tommy:** I've air-b-n-b-ed it for the month.

**Dan:** Why would you do that?!

**Tommy:** Relax. I'm gonna look after you. Just trust me, ok?

> Do you need some clothes? I'll get you something comfortable.
>
> *Dan is reluctant but has no choice. Tommy searches his stash.*

**Dan:** Hey, how come the police just let me go?

**Tommy:** Let's just say they're friends of mine. Believe it or not,
there are people on the

> realised yet, but you've landed yourself in the middle of a war.

**Dan:** A war?

**Tommy:** This whole park redesign 's been in the works for years.
We've spent a lotta

> time dealing with this bullshit.

**Dan:** I'm interning with the Parks department

**Tommy:** Yeah I know. You must be working for George. I saw you
putting up those

> posters earlier. You know the main reason they're doing all this is to
> get rid of us? All that stuff about aligning the fountain-

**Dan:** -I think George genuinely wants it all align-

**Tommy:** -This goes beyond George. This is about all of humanity. This
is about men in

> suits taking more than they need and giving back less than they can.
> This is about housing prices, and tourism, and-
>
> *Tommy searches his pockets. He hands Dan a flyer*

**Dan: "**See you on Wall St. Sept 17. Bring Tent." What is this?

**Tommy:** It's a call to action. You don't know it yet, but tomorrow is
going to be an

> important day. A day that they'll remember for years to come.

**Dan:** You're a terrorist?!

**Tommy:** Peaceful protests. Millions of people, camping out in parks,
all across the

> globe, for months. A global awakening.

**Dan:** What are you protesting?

**Tommy:** Everything! But mostly wealth inequality. The fact that 99%
of the world's

> wealth is controlled by a handful of people

**Dan:** I don't know if that's true

**Tommy:** Go on their website and you'll find several peer reviewed
articles citing

> academic studies that explain how wealth is distributed. Trust me,
> it's fucked.

**Dan:** What is protesting gonna do?

**Tommy:** Are you familiar with the Egyptian revolution?

**Dan:** Yeah, like, hundreds of people died.

**Tommy:** Yeah, that's true, but still. Millions of protesters flooded
to the streets and

> demanded a new president, and they won. That's the power of protest.

**Dan:** Kind of. They got rid of one despot, but he just got replaced
with another.

> They'll be protesting forever. Is it really worth risking your life?
> For what? To get the president to resign? That's just not gonna
> happen. And even if it did, that's not going to achieve anything.

**Tommy:** It's not the president we're protesting, it's corruption,
it's big business, it's

> election rigging, it's-

**Dan:** There's too many checks and balances.

**Tommy:** Well, they're not working. Look you don't have to do anything
to be a part of it.

> You live in this park, you're already helping. Even just by being

**Dan:** I don't know if I'm ready to be a poster boy for a revolution

**Tommy:** Oh get over yourself.

> *Tommy throws Dan some clothes.*

**Tommy:** Here, try these

> *Dan puts on some casual clothes.*

**Tommy:** Great. Now get some sleep kid. Tomorrow's a big day

**Dan:** Hey Tommy. What do you guys- what do we do in the winter?

**Tommy:** It's hard.

**Dan:** How do people survive in New York?

**Tommy:** They don't

> *Tommy leaves.. Projections of people suffering in new york.*

**Dan:** Ok. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep

I'm wired.

**Dan:** Think Dan think. What's the missing link

> Where's the nearest tap in case you need a drink

**Chorus:** Relax, close your eyes,

**Dan:** Where can I find something to eat

> At **least** I'm **not** allergic to wheat

**Chorus:** I am!

**George:** Goddamnit Daniel. Find me a solution. What do I pay you for

*Exit George.*

**Dan:** You don't pay me.

**Tommy:** If he was working the chainsaw I'm not convinced he wouldn't

**Dan:** Yeah. He's a little unpredictable

**Tommy:** That's probably what makes him so dangerous.

threatened.

**Dan:** Do I even look that messy? Why did he say I look scruffy? is
there

**Tommy:** The mobile showers don't come until wednesday.

**Dan:** Mobile showers?

**Dan:** I could...it just feels...wrong. And what if George is there?

**Tommy:** Fuck George

**Dan:** He's my boss.

**Dan:** Wait, you knew George as a kid? You went to school together?

back.

**Dan:** Does that mean my dad knew him too?

**Tommy:** How do you think you got the internship? Your dad probably
put in a good

**Dan:** Hey, I worked my ass off for this internship!

**Tommy:** Lots of people work there ass off. In that world, it's all
about who you know.

**Dan:** No way. Dad wouldn't do that. George would've said something

**Tommy:** Maybe you should ask him.

**Dan:** I'm gonna.

**George:** I made a few calls. The police are gonna meet us down there

**Tommy:** It's not over till it's over!

Our justice will be spoken

We will not be down
We will not be silent

And now my worlds collide

This park is occupied

How will I survive here on my own

pattern

**Casey:** Yeah, I heard washington square was the best place to stay

**Tommy:** It is. And we'd like to keep that way. The reason it's so

**Dan:** Ridiculous.

**Tommy:** How's life at the office?

**Dan:** He's nuts. He taking us to the mayor's office.

*They eat. Dan looks around*

**Dan:** The parks really filling up. It's like a festival. Don't these
people work?

**Tommy:** "These people"?

**Dan:** Sorry. They all look so happy. They're reading poetry and
singing songs. I

**
Dan:** I've never met a drag queen in person before

**Celine:** Excuse me?

**Dan:** Is that not what I'm supposed to call you? :o

**Celine:** You're joking

**Dan:** No. I didn't know. I'm sorry!

**Tommy:** He's cool, Celine. He's with me. He's just new in town.

**Dan:** I'm sooo sorry.

**Tommy:** I'll take this one.

> *Celine goes to play piano*

**Dan:** I'm sorry

**Tommy:** Celine is transgender. Calling her a Drag Queen is probably
one of the

> most insulting things you can do.

**Dan:** Oh my god. Why? I feel so bad.

**Tommy:** Well, "drag" is a style of performance. A drag queen is an
act; a character;

> often one that caricatures femininity for the sake of entertainment,
> while a transgender person is someone who was born with the body of
> the wrong gender.

**Dan:** What does that mean?

**Tommy:** Well, Celine was born with the body of a man, but inside
she's a woman

**Dan:** She wants to be a woman?

**Tommy:** She is a woman.

**Dan:** With the body of a man?

**Tommy:** Yes

**Dan:** Right.

> *Tommy can sense that Dan doesn't really get it.*

**Tommy:** A drag queen is a man, usually, who makes a performance out
of being a

> woman. Celine is a woman. When you asked if she was a drag queen, you
> were trivialising her identity

**Dan:** Oh no. I didn't mean to do that. Fuck. I don't know what to do
with all this

> politically correct mumbo jumbo. What do I do? How do I make it up to
> her?

**Tommy:** You could start by apologising?

**Dan:** Right.

**Tommy:** Ask her about her music.

**Dan:** Ok. I'm going.

> *Dan hesitates, but finally goes over to apologise.*

**Dan:** I just wanna say, I'm so sorry. I had no idea I was insulting
you. I feel so

> stupid. I'm from a small town, this is all so new to me. Can we just

>
> *Pause.*

**Celine:** Hello Dan.

> I'm Celine
>
> *Awkward.*

**Dan:** Tommy said you play piano?

> I mean- fuck
>
> He said you write songs? What do you write about? Oh- fuck.
>
> I'm such an idiot.

**Celine:** Relax Daniel;

**Dan:** I'm sorry

**Celine:** I'm not gonna bite your head off

**Dan:** I didn't mean to-

**Celine:** Dan! Seriously. Relax. You don't need to be so fucking
awkward.

**Dan:** Right.

choir; I went to

**Celine:** It was stupid.

**Celine:** Can you read charts?

**Dan:** A little.

> This is who I am

**Celine:** Ok. here we go.

**Celine:** Mama, don't tell me you know best

**Dan:** How long have you known?

**Celine:** I've felt something my whole life, but I only "found myself"
in college.

**Dan:** What does it feel like?

**Celine:** What does what feel like?

**Dan:** I don't know. Everything.

**Celine:** Well, until puberty it was all kinda simple. I was just me.
I moved the way I

> wanted. I was cute. My parents thought it was just a phase, that I'd
> "grow out of it". But then my body started changing, and people REALLY
> started treating me different. Junior high was brutal. I tried to see
> the counsellor, but they didn't get it. I just couldn't figure out why
> I felt the way I did. It wasn't until college that I realised it
> wasn't just me. It was like "There are others out there like me?!" And
> that was just, uh. Like, Yes. So I stopped pretending to be "normal"
> whatever the fuck that means, and just, yeah. Here I am now.

**Dan:** So, are you gonna- your parts-

**Celine:** I haven't transitioned yet.

**Dan:** Are you going to?

**Celine:** I've been thinking about it. It's really expensive. And it's
hard work. I don't

> know, sometimes I just don't think I'm ready. I mean, it's just such
> an ordeal.

**Dan:** How exactly does it...work?

**Celine:** Oh just google it. For fucks sake Daniel.

**Dan:** Ok ok. I'm sorry

**Dan:** That was so beautiful Jaz

**Jaz:** Oh thank you Dan. It's nice to see you taking an active

**Dan:** I had no idea your, voices?, were such a huge part of your
identity.

**Jaz:** We're incredibly lucky. A friend of mine had episodes where

**SCENE X**

**Celine:** I'm playing here!

**Casey:** You played all morning! When is it gonna be my turn?

**Tommy:** Guys, we can't be so petty. There's plenty of piano to go
round. I know you're

**Jerry:** They just arrested Johnny for chalking the sidewalk**.** Call
a general assembly

**Celine:** Eight of us met today to discuss safety. The police have

**Celine:** We suggest a 1 strike rule, after which we deliver

**Dan:** Do you hear yourself?

**George:** Excuse me?

**Dan:** This is a PARK. people come here to relax, to have

**George:** Tell me what this park is about, Dan.

**Dan:** Have you even talked to the people who hang out there? Just
stopped and

**George:** You're out of line Dan.

**Dan:** What is your problem? How did you get to be so smug?

**George:** You're starting to sound like one of those hippie dippie
protesters.

**Dan:** So what if I sound like them? Do you even know them? Have you
ever

**George:** You're on thin ice, Daniel. Don't think just cos I'm friends

**Dan:** Fuck you george. You're an insane, OCD, control freak. Just
because

You know how it is.

**Dan:** Wow. The mayor!

**Jojo:** Yeah it's pretty great. Maybe I can put in a good word for you
;)

*Pause.*

**Jojo:** So what's been going on with you?

**Dan:** I've been interning with the parks department.

**Jojo:** Wow! Good for you.

**Dan:** It's been a nightmare.

**Jojo:** I bet. George is nuts.

**Dan:** You know him?

**Jojo:** He's been working with us on this redesign project. These
protesters

**Dan:** Huh.

**Jojo:** But they'll be gone soon

**Dan:** Why do you say that?
