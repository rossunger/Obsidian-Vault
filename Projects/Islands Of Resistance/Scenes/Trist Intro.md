Trist wasn't proud of what they did for money. The dancing was fine,
and even taking clothes off for stranger\'s wasn\'t that bad, but Dr
Calamarino gave them the heebyjeebies. They called him Dr Calamari when
he wasn\'t around. Trist wasn\'t even sure he was a really doctor. He
didn\'t seem to care about people.

A while back he had called Trist into his office and made them an offer
they couldn\'t refuse. He said he would be offering a new service, on
the down low, helping queer folks with some very illegal surgeries, and
that he needed Trist to help him spread the word. At first Trist wanted
nothing to do with it, but when he told them how much he would be paying
them, they couldn\'t say no.

Standing here now with Ula yelling at them, they were realising that
their worst fears had become reality. In their heart of hearts they
already knew, but hearing it from another human hit home like a punch to
the gut. They were responsible. If they had just turned down the
money... The guilt swept over them like waves crashing on a cliffside.

"I didn\'t know". The words felt as flat as they sounded. "What can I do
to help?" Trist really respected Ula, and the thought of disappointing
them made Trist uncharacteristically helpful. They had been harboring a
growing infatuation with Ula, who seemed to have no time for such
shenanigans. Trist hoped that they could at least be close friends. They
felt like a better human around Ula.

"Help me look after Ali"

"What? How do I do that?"

"Show up. Bring them food. Read to them"

"I can\'t read"

"You\'ll figure it out"
