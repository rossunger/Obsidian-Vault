[[Jalzera]] was a ghost. Not the scary kind that haunts your dream, nor the
special forces kind that comes out of nowhere and makes people
disappear. Not even any of the dead kinds. Just a sweet, kind, loving
neighbourhood ghost. You probably wouldn't remember them if you'd met,
although I can't imagine how you could possibly forget, but it happens
every time and again. The only reason I remember is because I was lucky
enough to have them take me to the other side. See, there's a certain
way of being that allows you to become invisible to the nonsense drama
that seems to dominate humanity's awareness. a way to dodge the vortices
that suck you into neverending broken record stories. It takes
discipline. And a certain amount of faith. But at the core of it, anyone
could get there. Unlike the shapeshifters who disappear by fitting in,
the ghostsâ„¢ disappear by choosing not to play. They keep their attention
on what's important, and learn to swiftly leave the room when their
drama senses start tingling. Some might say their lives are boring, but
I know better. I think their lives are happier. More peaceful.
