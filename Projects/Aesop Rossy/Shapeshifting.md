I' been Shapeshifting, 
sifting through both trash and treasure,
try'na measure and sort out what goes where and what's missing, 
reminiscing 
about lifetimes 
that I barely remember, 
an ember 
of a teacher, 
I beseech her for a pardon, 
And the garden is blossoming, 
tossing me high in the sky 

and I'm cryin', 
I'm defying my elder, 
I tell her to kick it, 
I'm sick of it, 
Heavy is the burden of learning, 

and churning the wisdom:
there is none 
without the foundations, 

without all my relations I'm nothing, 
a pebble, 
a rebel alone in a void, 

And I toyed with notion of following orders 
but those waters are murky 
cos then how can you know who to trust? 
But you must,
Or you journey is hopeless

I know less 
now 
than when I opened the doorways,

In more ways than one 
Im a son of creator, 
I wait for
moments where wonder and clarity 
cut the disparity
between how we're meant to be living 
and how we've been going about it, 

I doubted too long 
and now it's time for a season of faith, 

and I crave authenticity, 
isn't she beautiful? 
Just, like, 
totally irrefutable?

Break all the rules! Be a fool,
Just as long as your true to your essence, 
your luminescence 
will light up the way, 
And I pray
  
for all of the teachin's to reach in and wash me of all the uncertainty, 
It's been hurtin' me 
badly, 
and sadly 
There more still to come, 

Yeah there's some of us aren't gonna make it,
I take it you know who you are, 

Well I'm sorry and thank you for everything, 
Weathering all of the terminal tragedies,

Gradually fading,
And wading through all of the muck, 

While I'm stuck shifting shapes,
drifting slowly through states 
of denial,
It's wild 
how our brain works, 

what lurks in the shadows is teaching us what we must face, 
I can trace all trauma and triggers to
ancestors, grand gestures gone wrong, 

all the times that we just played along 
when we should've said no, 
and so, 

here we are working out all the layers, 
the prayers, the visions, the lifelines, 
Raw is the process of healing
And Im feeling it 

Give me the strength to continue
I know that it's in you,
I've been you

I grant you permission to falter and stumble, 
it's humble, this contrary way
But hey,

If you are who you are, 
And you know what you know,
Then you mustnt let go,

For the sake of people, 
We call in the spirits and helpers, 
the shakers and shelters, 

the sacred rings of protective intentions, 
divine interventions,
And oh, did I mention?

this world's kinda magic
and It's mildly tragic
How we often forget

I don't know if there's anything else to be said,
M'sit, nokmaq
