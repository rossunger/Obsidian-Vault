Quinn, who would someday be the king of Q, awoke upside down, with hands tied to a bed frame. It wasn’t clear whose bed frame, but for Quinn this wasn’t unusual. They made little effort to uphold pretenses, even though they knew that the punishment was death, or worse: rehabilitation. Maybe it was because their father, who was the King of Q, had always bailed them out, even in the nastiest of nasties. 

As they looked around around the room for something to cut the ropes, Quinn jumped! They weren’t expecting to see the cloaked figure sloucing in the love seat across the room. 

KingQ: “If I’d known my son was queer I would found another way to deal with the anarchist rebellion. Have you seen the news?” “

Quinn: How did you find me?” 

KingQ: : “You think I don’t know exactly where you are at every moment of the day? 

After last week’s fiasco?”   

Quinn: “I gave Monico the slip”   

KingQ: “Monico is not my only way of tracking you. Have you seen the news?”   

Quinn: “Can you let me out of these?”  

KingQ: “They’re saying I’m unfit to rule. They’re gonna push for a leadership challenge.”

Quinn: That sucks  

KingQ: Do you know what this means?! Do you know what this means for YOU?  

Quinn: Nothing?  

King Q: Do you know what they do to your kind? Do you know what they do to people like you?

Quinn: Fuck off, dad.  

*Pause*

KingQ: I’m thinking of retiring

Quinn: Fuck dad, don’t joke about that  

KingQ: I’m serious. I’m tired of this shit. I thought I could fix everything but I’m just doing more of the same old shit.

Quinn: Can you at least sort out these fuckers 

KingQ: Don’t worry, I already had them executed. I’m just trying say that I won’t always be here to look out for you and get you out of trouble.

Quinn: You’re not really retiring

KingQ: I don’t know.

*KingQ leaves*

Quinn: Dad! Can you untie me? Fuck.
