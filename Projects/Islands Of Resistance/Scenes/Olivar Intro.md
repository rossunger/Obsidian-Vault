[[Olivar]] was tired. In their youth they seemed to have an endless surplus
of energy that allowed them to push through any adversity, which they
had to do frequently, but these days they had little patience for
conflict. Olivar was what one might call a shit disturber. Their life
philosophy was "question everything", which they did frequently much to
the chagrin of their friends and family. The only people that really
cherished his anti-establishment methodology were the [[friendly neighborhood revolutionaries]] who met weekly at the [[Plaza]].

Olivar had been scooped up into their entourage some 20 happy years
earlier, and was now realising that they might be the oldest in the
group, the vanguard. Perhaps it was time to retire and pass the reigns
onto someone else? To be honest, Olivar may have retired several years
earlier, but their son [[Xavier]] really loved coming, and these folks were
his friends. Olivar wasn\'t sure if they approved of such friends for a
10 year old, but it was the first time Xavier had really felt any sense
of belonging, and Olivar wasn't about to take that away from him.

The room went silent as a new face appeared in the doorway. "Ah.
Monsieur [[Lexler]]. You decided to join us! Come to see how deep this
rabbithole runs? You won\'t regret it."
