I value our friendship and I won't just cut you out
If you don't have the time for me, or if I can go without
You're not at risk of losing me, that's not what I'm about
I want you to feel safe because there's nothing worse than doubt

You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable

We're not in competition and we're not each others' threat
And we are not commodities to buy or sell like a-assets
\_ Our bond is born out of \_ deep care not debt
But living in the capitalist world makes us forget

You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable

Don't worry if you're going through something that makes you mad
Or if everyone is laughing but you're feeling kinda sad
\_ if you screw up and end up doing something bad
For sure I'm gonna help you if you ask me, I'll be glad to

You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable
You are not disposable

~~Moving house, and always changing schools,~~

~~Didn't leave much room for forming bonds~~

~~Sure, we don't have time for everyone~~

~~Growing up I learned to burn through people like matches in a box~~

~~Just as long as I could hold them till they burned me~~

~~Pickett fences like a fort~~

~~Prevent your neighbors from getting in~~

~~Friends just seemed to come and go~~

~~And I assumed~~

~~Just trying to survive~~

~~My nuclear family island left me feeling so alone~~

~~How can you feel part of a community when the players always
changing
