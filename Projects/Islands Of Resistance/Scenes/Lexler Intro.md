[[Lexler]] really believed what he said. He considered himself a scientific
man with a healthy dose of scepticism. For many years his colleagues had
considered him a litmus test for their theories because he could quickly
identify biases and inconsistencies, saving them months of work, which
is why everyone was so surprised when he came forward in support of the
giant flood theory.

The [[giant flood]] theory was a well worn religious hoodoo that had been
relegated to the realm of conspiracy theory and magical realism after
making the rounds 20 years earlier. In fact, the theory seamed to
resurface every 20 or 30 years to the demise of some poor scientist
who'd get hooked on the idea only to have their name dragged through
the mud by the establishment. Of course, this only fueled their
paranoia, and the conspiracy seemed to run deeper and deeper.

The theory had always intrigued Lexler from a sociological perspective.
He had wondered why scientist made the repeated mistake of pursuing such nonsense. One day he had found himself sitting in a [[late night social club]] when he was approached by a colleague who introduced him to a very peculiar friend. They got to talking and it turned out that this friend
was the foremost proponent of the giant flood theory. At first Lexler
was sceptically amused, but as the stranger told him of their
expeditions beyond the city limits, Lexlar became perplexed with his
inability to find the theory's flaws. It seemed with the finding of
this latest expedition there were some very tangible avenues of research
to pursue. The stranger left him with a number, and departed into the
night.

Lexler tried to put it from his mind but in the months that followed he
became obsessed. He would spend all his spare time thinking about it.
When asked what he was doing he would become mysterious and avoid
answering the question. He knew that if anyone found out he was even
contemplating the flood theory he would be a laughing stock.

...turns out to be a wild goose chase? Or the flood happens, but is man
made by freedom fighters?
