I love people that I love loving people that I love love love love loving
I love people that I love loving people that I love love love 
I love people that I love loving people that I love love love love loving

Sitting in the café, Sipping on my latte
Waiting for you to come by
She walks in, You're hand in hand

I love people that I love loving people that I love love love

We have a common love and affection
Some may try to downplay Our relationship status
but nothing can diminish our friendship

Cause we're metamours

I love people that I love loving people that I love love love love loving
