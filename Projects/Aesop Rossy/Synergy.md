# Synergy

I'm sensuously sliding in, long distance, business savvy, back door alley pal-ing with a Hali gal who's cards are pressed against her chest,
she's playfully impressed with jesting,
dressed in boyish charm, 
Requesting trust evolve in airs of peace and calm,
platonicly we're questing into lovers arms, 
No harm in testing murky waters, eh?
We're smirking, 
try'na see if there are hurts or feeling lurking
Shirking expectations, deftly we defy devouring emotions,
Gradually dismantling all the antiquated notions of what love and peaceful synergy can look like
When the energy is beating, grounded in a vibe that's hook-like
We're both aware and sailing slightly cautiously
Resisting misty siren song mysterious and nauseous, we take
Breathers and regroup at sights of sea foams splashing,
We avoid the dumb mistakes that caring couples make when thrashing, 
clashing as suggested by that old man hagel, 
dialecticly we squirrel and finagle,
All the differences we find into a holy bagel, 
I don't know but somehow we seem stable, 
Who needs labels when the tables turn our records into fables, 
Cradles hold us up like major giants 
In a tiny forest underneath a staircase filled with micro plants and grow lights
Dancing in the hallway make believing stripper poles in my hands
Stove pipes bring the heat and body scans the doe eyes,
Looking round perspectively prospecting vibes from woaah heights
Guess it's close to Midnight, time for saying no, right?
So why am I still up and writing all these faux rhymes

[[Two steps back, one step forward]]
