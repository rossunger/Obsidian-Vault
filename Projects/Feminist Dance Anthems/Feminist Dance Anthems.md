Feminist Dance Anthems is a project where we make dance-able songs, with lyrics about consent, gender, and other feminist ideas, based on our lived experiences. We host dance parties, and workshops, and we're gonna make music videos too. 

This is a collaborative project, designed and facilitated by Ross Unger. Let's live in a world where we can dance to fun songs with lyrics that make us feel good. 

VOLUME 1 now available on online stores and soundcloud:
https://soundcloud.com/dramaticchanges/sets/feminist-dance-anthems-vol-1

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES
1. Songs should explore themes of consent, gender, identity, toxic    masculinity, or any other international feminist / human rights ideas.  
2. Each song should have at least once significant section where the    Lyrics and melody are simple and catchy so that folks on the    dancefloor can sing along.
3. Listening to the songs should feel validating and empowering
4. Sensitive content should be handled sensitively
5. All the tracks should be Danceable, and produced in a way that would    work well in a club/Dance environment, and the recording quality    should be of a standard that venues and DJs would find "acceptable" to be used in those scenarios
