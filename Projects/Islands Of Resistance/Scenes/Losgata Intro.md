[[Losgata]] was numbed by the mundanity of this monotonous suburban life
that he had fallen into. As a light-plumber, he had not been destined to
live such a placated life, but having discovered something he wasn't
supposed to know while working what he thought was a regular job, his
options became limited. He understood that when he was offered this
promotion that it wasn't really an offer, and that the alternative was
probably some light-less existence where he would whither away, far from
everyone and everything he loved.

He sat on the porch of his immaculately designed [[Octalonian]], and
wondered whether it was intentional that these cookie-cutter
neighbourhoods dulled the mind into complacent obedience, or whether
that was just a bi-product of having no sense of purpose or direction.
Some days he contemplated throwing a rock through the light-channel,
hoping that it might rupture and need fixing, just to give himself
something to do, but he knew well enough how solid this light-tech was,
and it would take a hell of a lot more than a rock to put a dent it.

Losgata had spent the first decade of his premature retirement
contemplating ways to escape, physically, spiritually, and
metaphorically. At first he had hoped there was some way to slip away,
or get word of the truth to the people who needed to hear it, but
surveillance was thorough, and allegiances here were thick as thieves.
He tried focusing his attention on hobbies, and recreation, and even
learned how to engage in the inane conversations that seemed to
endlessly fascinate these social circles, but wearing your heart of your
sleeve makes you a poor liar, and his attempts at feigned interest
reeked of secret disgust and only made people like him less.

Losgata had become a light-plumber both out of passion, and necessity.
Living below the blackout line, he had always been intrigued by
technology, repairing anything he could get his hands on. When his
little sister was born with a heart condition, he knew his family
wouldn't have enough [[light-credits]] to give her the treatment she needed,
so he decided to give her all of his and enlist in the academy, hoping
that he'd be able to find enough ambient light on the job to at least
survive until she was better.

Joining the academy was social suicide below the blackout line, because
everyone knew that those light-techs were the only reason the blackout
line continued to exist as high up as it did; [[Light-channels]] diverting
all the natural light, redistributing it around the city as those
upstairs deemed fit. Every year it seems to climb a little higher.
Without the light-techs, saboteurs would make short work of the
infrastructure and bring light back to the slums; maybe there could even
be enough light to send some down to the undergrounds.
