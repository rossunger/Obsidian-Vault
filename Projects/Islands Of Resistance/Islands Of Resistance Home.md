IDEAS

- Religions condoned by government\...
- Historic artefacts form splinter religions that the government squashes, but it keeps coming up because history never dies\...
- Erasure of history = threat

Game format:
What if everyone\'s remembering the story\... Then if there are
inconsistency, we can attribute it to memory inaccuracy

Conflicts:
\- running out of sunpatches
\- elevator breaking down
\- refugee clan moving in
\- controversial festival
\- death in the community
\- police raid / arrest
\- circus comes to this floor
\- Flash storm\... No sunlight for a night
\- new candidate calls for an election
\- new government policy
\- water pump malfunction
\- HVAC malfunction

Overarching story points:
- rebels discover the technology in the museum
- King of q \"retires\" and the Prince takes over
- the people discover the solar panel truths
- scientists realise the nobody has a broad enough understanding of anything to fix the city which is slowly deteriorating.
- branching options: giant flood theory is true, and they escape on aboat; the agents of change overthrow the government; the secret to the sunpatches tech gets open sourced
- the trees reconnect via the underground mycelium and take over the city

Always only half joking

Characters:
- Tallis waking encyclopedia
- Counselling character
- Festival host, interviewing everyone
- Sun priest, city priest
- Character seeking near death experiences
- Tattoo character
- human Trees connect via wifi? Help the revolution? At first they don\'t care, because they don\'t identify as humans anymore, but when they hear about all the isolation that everyone is feeling they relate to their mycelium problems and rediscover their humanity?

VR Game premise:
- You are a government agent using a very experimental tool that allows you to experience life from other people's perspective, like VR. The government wants you to spy on the people and report any suspicious activity. You can choose WHO to follow, and WHAT to report on.

- Maybe at night, you can try to help the people you've been spying on? eventually

What does the Q stand for?
-   Queen
-   Queer
-   Quantum
-   Quality

What happens if you don\'t get enough Sun? How is it obvious if someone
has less Sun and what does that say about the class system

VR technical design thoughts
1) Each floor is a separate level, with the elevator being the persistent level... never need to see more than one floor at once

2) The 3d model for the city doesn't need to be too detailed

3) Is it helpful to have Floor maps?

4) Should make a rule for how high each floor is... e.g. every extra
    > floor gains 5% heigh

    a.  2m, 2.1m, 2.21m, 2.321m, 2.4321m, 2.54321, etc.

3D Models that we need:
-   People + clothes
-   People's homes
    -   Beds 
-   Forest room
    -   Mother tree
-   University floor
   

[SUMMARY FOR WORLD-BUILDERS]{.underline}

The year is 2139, or at least that\'s what they tell us. It's hard to
know what's true anymore. History has been re-written, of this we are
certain. All we know is that at some point the earth was full of life,
with billions of people spread across the planet. Then the atmosphere
changed. Now, direct sunlight is toxic, and we all inhabit "The "City",
whose miraculous engineering filters the light that we need so
desperately to survive

Through the centre of the City runs a giant elevator. At the top live
the rich and powerful, and they get all the sun they need. As you
descend, you can see the class divide. You know which floor someone
comes from, just by the amount of sunlight they've had. As you get below
the "blackout" line, you realise that almost half the city's population
is living without sunlight, kept alive by the trademarked "Sun-patches".

Beyond the walls of the city, the refugee camps span out for days. Folks
trying to get into the city. If only they knew what life was like in
here. Corporations control the government. The masses are apathetic.
Millions are sun-starving. Some see the city as a god, I see it as a
demon. I yearn for the day when the prophecies come true, and the city
falls apart to make way for new lives. It's already happening. I can
feel it. I just hope that I live long enough to see it.

Your writing should be set in the same universe as this novel. Here are
things you should know about this universe:

-   It\'s our universe, but set in the future, probably the middle of
    > the 22nd century

-   The government has distorted or destroyed most of the history
    > records, so people either don\'t know what happened in our time,
    > or have a ridiculously wrong idea about it. Sometimes you can find
    > illegal books that tell the truth, but without context they can
    > seem like nonsense.

-   The Sun in our atmosphere has become dangerous and exposure to
    > direct sunlight is fatal for most people.

-   Most People live in "the city", which is full of skyscrapers, and is
    > entirely enclosed in a glass-like substance that filters the
    > sunlight to be good for humans again. Outside the city are refugee
    > camps, with people barely surviving, waiting to be let into the
    > city which is "at capacity"

-   The city was built as a solution to a climate crisis, and the design
    > was led by 4 brilliant individuals who had a utopian vision for
    > the future. However, their descendants corrupted this vision, and
    > now the wealthy control the sunlight. Folks with money live at the
    > top of buildings and get as much sunlight as they want, while the
    > poor live at the bottom and don't get any sun.

-   There is an elevator system that allows folks to go up and down, but
    > it is illegal to go to higher floors without a permit, and the
    > elevator scans your eyes to identify you before you can enter.

-   There have been numerous technological advances, all of which are
    > trademarked secrets and intellectual property of the wealthy:

    -   "Sun patches", kinda like nicotine patches, can replace a
        > person\'s daily Sun intake, however they are not cheap. The
        > middle class can afford them, but folks at the bottom levels
        > can\'t. These patches can replace food also, as they provide
        > energy to your body.

    -   "The circuitry" is a brain implant that allows the controller to
        > zap you, and is used as a form of control, or torture. Mostly
        > used by police, or very controlling parents.

    -   Solar panels are made from chlorophyll and function like plants.
        > These are what power the city. Nobody knows this, but these
        > Solar panels are actual humans who have been injected with
        > chlorophyll... the government has been using prisoners to
        > power the city.

    -   The radicals sometimes use amnesia pills in case they get
        > interrogated which make them forget what they\'ve done.

-   In the last 30 years the government started the gender police and
    > has been waging a war on gender nonconformity. The current ruler,
    > King of Q, started it for political reasons, but is now thinking
    > of ending it because their adult son is queer, and it has served
    > it's political purpose.

-   Their son, Prince of Q, has been running a kind of queer Mafia,
    > getting away with anything because of their father\'s protection.
    > They are an anonymous patron of the Quinn, an infamous underground
    > queer bar in the lower levels.

-   There are at least 2 sets of revolutionaries: the friendly
    > neighborhood revolutionaries, and the Agents of changes, the
    > latter being radicals who aren\'t afraid to be violent

-   Within the city, there are folks who hate the city and are planning
    > a way to escape and build their own city. They just need to steal
    > all the secrets of the technology.

Architectural Facts:

1)  City Scale:
- The top floor is 5000 sq m and is owned by the 5 richest people in the in city, giving them 1000sq m each
- By the time you descended to the Middle floor, there is only 100 sqm per person
- At the blackout line, there is a mere 10 sq m per person
- Underground, each person has only 4 sq m to themselves, with an additional 1 sq m that is communally shared with 10 people
- People in Cryogenic-stasis are frozen in 1 m sq blocks.
- The bottom floor is 20k m x 20km, full of slums
- The top floor is a pentagon, with a radius of 2.8km
- The city is 2.5km tall, excluding the underground part.
   
2)  What is the population of the city?
    a.  Approximately 64million.
    b.  How many refugees are there? 10 million?

3)  City Infrastructure
-  A giant elevator runs the height of the building and is the only way up or down
- Fiberglass cables distribute sunlight across the city.
- Auxiliary Lights.
- HVAC?
- Roads and public transport?
- Plumbing and Sewage?
- Sound-proofing?
- Electricity is generated by human solar panels.

CULTURAL FACTS
1)  There are several cultural organisations/religions:
    a.  Soli-sola: who worship/fear the sun
    b.  Metropolisas: who worship the city as a god
    c.  Arboralias: who worship the Trees
    d.  Agents of change: the violent radicals / freedom fighters.
    e.  friendly neighbourhood revolutionaries: the peaceful anti-establishment
    f.  The circus: an esoteric wandering troupe that spends 1 day on each floor
    g.  

2)  There have been no animals in the city for long enough that most people don't remember that they ever existed.

3)  It is quite possible that nobody is left alive who knows how to make all the technologies that built the city, and the city is starting to fall apart.

4)  Mythologies:
    a.  A splinter civilization that's underground, that survives from the heat of the earth, and the mycelium under the city.
    b.  Prophecies of a great flood and the collapse of the city
    c.  The founders hid a copy of the city's most vital technologies
