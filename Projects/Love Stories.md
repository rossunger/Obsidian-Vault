Falling

Cry for me 

I will be falling through eternity

  
  
  

Take A Piece Of My Heart

Take a piece of heart

And carry it wherever you go

A beacon to guide you back

Whenever you find that you have lost the way

Just call my name

  

And I will find you, I will find you

Whenever you’ve lost the way

And I will guide you, I will guide you

Back to where you belong

And I will show you, I will show you

The colors of all the world

And when you see them, and you will see them

You’ll start to lift and understand

  

I Love You Still

I cry for you

I cry for your heart

For the love there inside now it’s dead though it died without a cause

  

I feel for you

I feel for your heart

For the look in your eyes as we said our goodbyes forevermore

  

There was no time

It had to die

I loved you then I love you still

  

Illorum Qui Amant

  

Today I Save The Life Of An Innocent

  

Today I save the life of the innocent

Blackened with misery sin and woe

I shoulder their burden and trudge through the snow

Alone with the weight of an unwanted foe

  

They offer no thank you no signs of remorse

No unbidden cognisense of my painful enforcement

Of my loneliness since then my soul is enslaved

By a love that respects it no more than it hates

  

So i cry not from pity nor pain nor regret

I cry for the soul who will drown and forget

How to love how to smile how to sour through the sky

While a burden not his will devour his life

  

Have To

(Sophia Edited)

  

You don't have to love me

But I don't have a choice

You don't get all happy every time you hear my voice

Like you used to

But I still cling to the edges of hope 

And I still share knowing you will listen

Even when your love for me has vanished

  
  

You don't have to want me

But I can't help but hope

Every little dittie

Brings me closer to my dreams

That I make up trying to get back to

What I imagine our love could be

...

  
  

You don't have to touch me

But I want you to

You don’t have to give me…

My hands reach up pleading

And fall back down empty

...

  
  

You don't have to think of me

But I think you do

And I think of you

More than I ought to

And want this blossoming love affair

To be colossal and beyond repair 

Instead of half started

...

  

You don't have to hold me

But you do it just the same

And I don’t stop you 

Knowing this loving isn’t fair

...

  
  

You don't have to be with me

But we're on the same plane

We would be so good for each other

If only you thought the same

...

  
  

K2

  

One of thought of you and suddenly you're coursing through my veins

You fill my mind you lift me up 

and steal my breath away

And all I want in all the world

Is just to hold you close

To be near you to feel you 

and know you inside out

There May Be Days

There may be days when you are down

When the world comes crashing down around you

One day you’ll see that you are blind

That all your troubles are behind you

The sky may be gray the sun may go away but you will still be there

  

And so you live a life of lies 

and then you wonder why your heart cries

the world revolves it’s keeping time, 

The time that passes by defining your spirit that cries my love for you that dies and slowly the poison spreads

  

But the pain is not so great that I must leave the world on your account

  

a rose of love was sent to you

it never made it past the waiting queue

it chose to die rather than live

what’s the point when nobody would give it more than the slightest

thought the love that it sought was missing, what could it do?

  

the road it sought to find in you had not been born until too late

  

All spinning wheels must sometimes stop

that doesn’t mean that they can’t start again

the heart can only take so much after which it slowly starts to drown but such is life, a double edged knife that stabs you when you least expect it to

  

Libera Mea Cuore

Livera mea cuore

Cuore trista, trista, tristisime

Oh lacrime verso

Compatisci me te imploro 

Libera mea cuore

In The Night

  

At the break of dawn

She will be alone again just as she always is

Just as she always does she’ll cry

  

If they knew how hard she tries to make them all feel loved 

But what did they ever do, what did they 

ever do for her?

  

In the night we they move like flies

In the night they cry all the time

In the night they fly

Forever

The flowers blossom on a mid winters day

They know they cannot believe what they say

Running around in pairs of three

They know they will not be forgotten

  

No one noticed as he fell to the ground

His eyes unfocused and his thoughts all around

Her eyes her nose her lips her little hands

He spoke of love but got no answer

  

You’re breaking my heart as I die in the snow and wait for death to take me home

But home would be with you wherever you should be now and forever

I am alone and so I say goodbye

  

She stood in silence as he laid down his heart

Her hands were dz shaking; she was playing her parts

He was so serious she had to laugh

She turned to look but he was gone

  

The truth it hit her she had noone to blame

Moments of happiness and moments of shame

In all the years that they had been but friends

It seems he’d loved her from the start

  

You’re breaking my heart as you run from my life and leave behind all that you love

What is this I feel whenever you are not around I never thought that I could love from as we say goodbye

  

At last she found him letting tears to the snow

She kissed his forehead and never let go

She knew too well his time was running out

She held him close and made the best of their last days on earth

  

The snow keeps falling as they wait in the cue

Her mother’s calling but what can she do

She knows they will not be alone again

He will not make it through the night

  

You’re breaking my heart as you die in my arms while those around you fret and cry

They don’t know that you live forever 

Nothing ever lasts forever

All I know is this is where we say goodbye

At The End

At the end of the day the flowers will be blooming

And those who believe in them will see that there is light

in the dark, at the end of the day

  

At the end of the day our love will rise again

Through the dust and the shadows

Our love will rise again

For it comes at the end of the day

  

You are my love tonight forever till we die

You the only one for 

There is no one dead or living who can see

That being happy alone can be lonely

  

At the end of the day you’ll hold my hand and smile

Nevermore to be lonely our love will guide us through

To the end at the end of the day

  

Through the darkness and the shadow

And the cold within you too

Where you are it will not matter 

I will find and shelter you

  

From the storm that is still coming and the storm within you too

When you’re frozen and your heart beats ever faster

I will show you life full of love and then 

You’ll keep moving on

  

You are my love tonight forever till I die

You the only one who will ever see the heart within me

And behold all the love there inside it is yours

  

You are my love tonight forever till I die

You the only one who will ever see the heart within me

And behold all the love there inside it is yours

After The Storm

After the storm come peaceful tides

The place where dire hope resides

Where anger and anguish are mere memories

  

Faith, a serenade

what could be more truly made than

the way I feel for you

I know my heart is true

Forgive Me

  

How about we begin again

Light the candle let the violets in

Help them to grow into mighty things

Stop the candle from extinguishing

  

How about we forget this place

Run away and live out old cliches

Take to the mountains and the parking lots

Fin'lly learn to cherish what we've got

  

How about no more arguments

Unplug the power from you electric fence

Let me run wild in your garden of lies

And let me burn the flowers I despise

  

How about I burn the garden down

No more lies and you can burn my crown

What if you found that there was nothing left

Would you forgive me my dearly bereft

  

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;

Please forgive me my love

  

How about we take a break from "no"

Don't ignore me when I beg "don't go"

Have you forgotten what I did for you

Well, can't say I'm surprised, fuck you too

  

How about we fin'lly call it quits

Load the baggage up and end this shit

Wait for the buses which will take us home

And dispose of all this love we've grown

  

How about you forget my name

Close your mind and filter out the pain

Turn to those friends who have forgotten you

Build those broken bridges up anew

  

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;

Please forgive me; Please forgive me;

Please forgive me my love

And then help me to move on

  
  

Our Dancing Days Are Through

  

Our time is up

Our dancing days are over

Now we only talk of small things

And wonder what we did before

  

We pulled the plug

Set free all our emotions

But turns out that you're still hurting

And there's nothing I can do

  

We’re Through

  

Was it something I said

Or something I did

We were so good just before

And now we're shit

  

Tell me what to do to make it good

Tell me how on earth you think I should

Move on and just forget someone like you

Someone like you

Can't you see you make me feel alive

I've been waiting for you all my life

And now, you say we're through

  

You were gone for a day

I was there for years

You didn't even have time to say goodbye

Or shed some tears

  

Maybe I could be somebody else

Maybe you could change the way you felt so sure

That there was no more time for me

Someone like me

Can't you see you make me feel alive

I've been waiting for you all my life

And now, you say we're through

  

I believe that everyone can learn to fly together

So why you tellin' me that we can't be no more

  

Tell me what to do to make it good

Tell me how on earth you think I should

Move on and just forget someone like you

Someone like you

Maybe I could be somebody else

Maybe you could change the way you felt so sure

That there was no more time for me 

Someone like me

Can't you see you make me feel alive

I've been waiting for you all your life

And now, you say we're through

The World

  

When I hold you in my arms, I’m pretty sure the world revolves ‘round us

Even in the darkness of the night, I can still believe in a world of light

Cry for all the sadness in your soul, even though we live in a different world

Even though he doesn’t understand, she will be the one to hold your hand in the end

Don’t Know

You broke my heart,

flew away when things got hard

I didn’t mind, I knew that it would heal in time

All the bitter memories

All the wasted hope

How did we ever forget the meaning of love

And how do we carry on without it I just don’t 

Know, anymore, why we live or love at all

You waste my time with broken words and broken lies

I waste your life say I love, but really die, 

All the bitter memories

All the wasted hope

How did we ever forget the meaning of love

And how do we carry on without it I just don’t know

what to do, I cannot live without your soul next to mine

I find I cannot reconcile

All the bitter memories

All the wasted hope

How did we ever forget the meaning of love

And how do we carry on without it I just don’t 

  

Wonderful

I had no doubt but turns out your wonderful

You’re filling my mind and I suddenly find that I am missing you

And it’s not ok, not in any way

I just wanna be your friend but I don’t how

  

You suddenly kiss me and suddenly yeah!

I’m blinded bliss and I falling through air

You suddenly kiss me and blinded by bliss

I subtly miss all the sign of abyss

How you cry how you fall how you oh oh oh

  

I just wanna say I’m sorry

I just wanna relive moments of our glory

Moment of our former glory

  
  

Don’t Be Scared Boy

  

In an empty lot we built a shelter even though we had a home

Before sunrise is how it felt

We walked for hours talked our fill and then we stopped

Before midnight we’re on a hill

Pulled a 20 dollar wedding dress up to our chin

I made a cavern and you fell in

  

Don’t Be Scared Boy this is who you are

We took turns blurring lines between what makes us boy and girl

Danced through fields of gold and time stood still

1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 4 and

  
  

Can’t Get You Out Of My Mind

  

I can’t get you out of my mind

And maybe I don’t want to

Maybe I don’t know how or why

But you …

  

And don’t you know you‘ve been

Bathtub Space Machine

  

We’ll row our way through town in our bathtub space machine

You’ll rub me down, I’ll rub you off our play be obscene

my scent will scream through foreign words, you’ll giggle as we drown

We’ve lost the plot, our life’s surreal, we’ll paint the greens as brown

  

The bug keeps spitting popcorn on your face

and I keep melting in your sweet embrace

smell my armpits, eat my hair, take me with you everywhere

let this be a tale of duck and bear 

  
  
  

As I Live And Breathe

  

When I close my eyes 

You float across my mind 

And I just want to fly to you and 

Wander by your side

  

You live and breathe inside of me, 

I drown as I run out of you

I see your face on every tree, 

I lose I mind when I don’t see you

  
  

Winter Scars

You come home and fall to sleep

You wake up and rush to leave

It's almost like you wish I wasn't here

  

You'll drink caffeine to see your friends

But you're too tired to make amends with me

It's like you honestly don't care

  

So why am I still here? 

What did I see in you that made me volunteer my heart, my time, 

and dedicate my life to you 

if even for a year or two

  

Why did you drag me all this way across the world

When you were still in love with another girl

Don't tell me that you love us both when I can see 

You're sick of me and loathe that I am in your bed not she

When she's not even sure she wants you

She taunts you

She haunts you

  

When they're in the room you make me small

When they leave I fade against the wall

You make me feel invisible

  

We've both made compromises, both had it tough

You pour yourself another even though you've had enough

Your words are gonna beat me to a pulp

  

You've lit your fuse, you've blocked your ears

You're gonna blow, I'll end in tears

  

You smash my heart with your crowbar words

I shiver helplessly under the kitchen herbs

It doesn't help to know we'll be alright

  

So why am I still here? 

What did I see in you that made me volunteer my heart, my time, 

and dedicate my life to you 

if even for a year or two

  

Why did you drag me all this way across the world

When you were still in love with another girl

Don't tell me that you love us both when I can see 

You're sick of me and loathe that I am in your bed not she

When she's not even sure she wants you

She taunts you

She haunts you

  

You've lost your kindness, you've lost your words

Your sense of reason has grown absurd

You don't come home, you didn't call

I drank your whiskey trying to fill the hole

  

I'm sorry if I trashed your room, but look at what you've done to me

What are you still doing here?

What are you still doing here?

What are you still doing here?

  

Your biting words sink teeth in skin

And puncture vitals from within

I should shred my shrivelled spinal cord asunder

  

ignored  /  bored

torn / forlorn

  

Bird And Bear

Bird takes a walk down sydney road

bear has a hunger for flying

bird says to bear man the badgers fried and the kettle’s cooked and crying aw yeah

  

Bird brings a blanket of feathery down

Bear brings a fur to the table

Bird says to bear if I spill some milk should I clean it if I am able 

  

Two unlikely creatures walking walking on the town

Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns

  

Bird has a box of empty matches

Bear has a silver spoon

Neither cares what the public thinks

they’re gonna make their dreams come true

  

Bird and bear take a trip with hare

Gonna hop like party rabbits

Bear drops his dacks and bird gives a quick

Hey, we all got unlikely habits

  

Two unlikely creatures walking walking on the town

Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns

  

Bear’s got a plan for sunday morning, 

Bird’s gotta fly the coop

Bear forgets, but there’s no regrets cos the cat is in the soup

  

Two unlikely creatures walking, walking on the town

Wondering if their wacky games will somehow lift some frowns

  

Bambi And Rabbit

  

Bambi and rabbit by the fire

Holding hands down in the dark

Out of nowhere comes a __

  

Bambi and rabbit by the fire

Waiting for their cup of tea

  
  

Bambi and rabbit by the bus loop

Waiting for that summer bus

Bambi meowing 

  
  
  

Bambi and Rabbit by the fire

Holding hands bambi says goodbye

The kisses in her eyes are glowing

and the badger knows its time

  

Give Me A Reason

  

That's the second tub of ice-cream gone

And the dirty clothes are piling up

No guests have sat on beer stained couch for days or weeks or maybe months? who knows.

  

I've changed the channel maybe 50 times

the same three shows diffuse my brain

And sleep would seem a heaven sent

if only Sunday wasn't such a waste

  

Give me a reason to wake up another day

or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

  

A Face of blonde and eyes of green, Synaptic floods un-stitch my seams

An impulse drives me up about, I lace my boots and stutter out

roll down the street of mem'ry lane, and find a house with iv'ry cane

I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I'm here. I don't why I'm here, and faith give in to fear

  

Give me a reason to wake up another day

or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

  

I ring the bell, you ope' the door, a feral pussy licks the floor

I don't know why I came to you, we made some tea, you drank some stew

A lonely night spoke words so few, you smoked through pleasantries and then she

came along and said goodnight, I left the building with no light

  

Give me a reason to wake up another day

or Show me some kinda sign that there's a plan, a better way to be

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

Than slowly decomposing in this pointless world of grey

  
  

Hashera

Hashera don’t make me choose

I don’t wanna lose either of you

Woah hashera why can’t you just agree to this polyamoury and let me love you. 

  

I introduced you to my friend you hit it off and then you spent

the weekend in each other’s glove

and now you think that you’re in love

  

Hashera don’t make me choose

I don’t wanna lose either of you

Woah hashera why can’t you just agree to this polyamoury and let me love you. 

  

Turn Back The Time

Give me the words to turn back the time

To stop you from lying awake every night

To stop you from crying through your bailey’s and milk

thinking nothing can sew up the tears in your silk

  

The silk of your heartstring which play like a harp

I’m sorry I plucked them with fingers so sharp

The heart is a system made of sinews and blood

and I’m sorry dropped yours in a river of mud

But usually people have nylon to spare

And i’m sorry you’re drowning in floods of despair

And I don't know how I can help you now

Are You What You Say You Are (KP)

You make me smile when you look at me

and I don’t know why but it’s unsettling

to know that you love but that you don’t want me

  

You may be nice, and I don’t know why it doesn’t suffice

for my tender sensibilities 

you know I want you here with me

  

Are you what you say you are?

Or are you just fucking with my mind

And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more

  

Are you what you say you are?

Or are you just fucking with my soul

and do I trust your well formed lies, or should I bring a change of heart

Are you what you say you are?

or have you been playing from the start

and am I gonna be alright or should I bring a change of heart

tell me what’s the price of pain, or should I charge you by the hour?

and I don’t really play these games, so whats the point of all this power

  

Are you what you say you are?

Or are you just fucking with my head

and do I trust your well formed lies, or should I bring a change of heart

Are you what you say you are?

or were you playing from the start

and am I gonna be alright or should I bring a change of heart

tell me what’s the price of pain, or should I charge you by the hour?

And I don’t really play these games, so whats the point of all this power

Are you what you say you are?

Or are you just fucking with my soul

And do I really want your bones or will they leave me feeling cold

And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more

a minute more

  

Are you what you say you are?

Or are you just fucking with my soul

And I will be your closest friend if I could just hold you for a minute more

a minute more

Preserve The Royal Bloodline

Massage my back with needle gloves

We'll all sit in a circle

And like the candle brightly glows

We'll lose our shirts to soft pillows

These lively friends will soon be friendly lovers

  

Ill wrap my legs around your legs

We'll have a slumber party

And when I gently kiss your neck

Just treat it like a friendly peck

And if you want my finger ask me nicely

  

I want your blood inside my blood

Preserve the Royal bloodline

Party it down on astro turf

  

Your Love

(lyrics by Rose Muller)

  

You love has got me trapped inside an open cage

If you keep feeding me, acting like you're needing me

I won't ever leave

  

But fear is a goddess who won't keep me for long

Cause really I'm the captor and you are just an actor, 

paid to scream on cue, 

but now I've risen above you

  

Never looking back, no

your reality is whack, no

I'm sick of your love boy

  

Wondering through your maze, boy

Your presence is a haze boy

I'm so confused by you, no

  

Never looking down, no

Wond'ring if you've found, no 

A room in your heart for me

  

You love has got me trapped inside an open cage

And I can't even reach you, cos you're a little leach, you don't really care about me

Cause really I'm the lover, and you're just a fighter paid to point and shoot

but now I've risen above you

  

Never looking back, no

your reality is whack, yo

I'm sick of your love boy

  

Wondering through your maze, boy

Your presence is a haze boy

I'm so confused by you, no

  

Never looking down, no

Wond'ring if you've found, no 

A little room in your heart for me

Kindred Spirits

You don’t have to fill the silence

I don’t have to hold your hand

phantom limbs betray our senses

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

  

lose our heads and loose our shoulders

all our laughters eggs and jam

breakfast is a wholesome option 

help me find out who I am

  

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred souls

  

You don’t have to think like I do, you don’t have to like gazelles

just dance your heart like no one’s watching

and tell me you can be yourself

  

lose our heads and loose our shoulders

all our laughters eggs and jam

breakfast is a wholesome option 

help me find out who I am

  

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred souls

  

grab a tree branch strum a chord

raise the past and press record

you part your lips and through the gloom 

angelic voices fill the room

  

You don’t have to fill the silence

I don’t have to hold your hand

just dance your heart like no one’s watching

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

  

lose our heads and loose our shoulders

all our laughters eggs and jam

breakfast is a wholesome option 

help me find out who I am

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred spirits

we are kind and kindred souls

  
  
  
  

You don’t understand

  

Forget Forever

  

Fort Mac

I crossed over seas to be with her,

Now I wither away in a

Small country town

Fueled by tar oil sands 

Fueled by tar oil sands 

Fueled by tar oil sands 

  

I go to church in a gym, play piano and sing

Put up cameras for cash, they don't pay me enough for the work I do

Everyone here drives a truck and the sit in their Sports bars, snorting their Drugs

just a year down the line, just a year down the line

they'll be all burning down

they'll be burning down

they'll be burning down

  

I came to be wife, now I feel like a trophy

Playing piano in my birthday tux

Smoking tobacco to release the frustration

She don't want me here, nobody wants me here

  

Negative 30, feels like 40 below

Never been in a blizzard, now my mouth's full of snow

Thought I'd walk to a forests or a lake

lay my head on a log, close my eyes, clear my mind

my brain is fogging up

  

tried nonmonogomy, 

this polyamory 

quickly enamoured me, 

lost in the in between

kissed a cute girl I knew, 

her husband got mad at me, 

can't go to town no more, 

stuck on a condo floor

  

Im sorry I wasnt good enough

Im sorry that I couldn't pick you up

Im sorry that I had to leave so soon

  
  
  
  

Magnetic

You don’t have to worry

I’ll be there soon

When the lights go and the fire has all but subside

I will find you heart a new

  

Sensitive Robot

Sensitive Robot

KATIE

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He drives me crazy, and he’s gotta go

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

….

…..

…..

……

……

…..

A shoestring budget

and likes to calculate precisely what it costs

To be in love with me

Someone insane as me

To be in love with a sensitive me

  

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He’s such a confident fella; sometimes I forget

He still has feelings

Is always dealing

With existential crises 

And conflicting lies, 

He loves contriving

Is always striving

To find a better way to minimize the loss

Of being loved by me

Someone insane as me

I can't believe that he's living with me

  

ROSS

I’m in love with a sensitive psycho

She drives me crazy and she’s gotta go

I’m in-

  

KATIE

-Then he tries to be romantic, but the words all come out wrong

He talks about “my function” but he means to say that we belong

  

Sometimes he’s lazy

And I go a crazy 

And stir up wild disputes

His brain does not compute

He has no filter

Gets out of kilter

When I’m sarcastic or passively aggressive

But still we make it through

  

ROSS

I don’t know how we do

  
DUET

I’m just in love with a sensitive you

  

DUET

I tell him/her all these stories full of petty pointless facts

I know they really bore him/her but still s/he will react

To make me feel appreciated

Psychotic/Robotic love is underrated

  

My sensitive robot like to hide behind a facade of facts 

….relax / contracts

  

BRIDGE

  

But when s/he curls up in my arms

And fires up his/her snuggling charms

You know s/he melts my little heart

  

ENDING

  

You can’t help it if you’re smart

It doesn’t change what’s in your heart

  

You might not think the way I do

But god knows robots feel things too

  

He stacks the dishes

Makes eyelash wishes

  

I tell him stories

with ducks and _  (s,s,s, + trees, cheese, breeze, )

  

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

At least he doesn’t pretend to be what he’s not

He likes to throw snot,

And doesn’t know what

To do when I am mad

But he’s not all bad

He stacks the dishes

Makes eyelash wishes

and likes to calculate precisely what it costs

To be in love with me

Someone insane as me

To be in love with a sensitive me

  

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He drives me crazy, but he’s all I’ve got

I’m in love with a sensitive robot

He’s such a confident fella; sometimes I forget

He still has feelings

Is always dealing

With existential crises 

And conflicting lies, 

He loves contriving

Is always striving

To find a better way to minimize the loss

Of being loved by me

Someone insane as me

I can't believe that he's living with me

  

you may always win at chess

but you don’t need to be the best

you just can’t help it if you’re smart

doesn’t change what’s in your heart 

  
  
  

I Was Alright (E6)

  

I was alright till you came into my life

Taught me how to feel by breaking my little heart

You were my friend, that’s how these things always start

And looking back I’m wondering how do you tell the two apart

Trust Too Much

When you feel too much and it blows up in your face

When you know how to love but you don’t see a trace

Of why you came here in the first place

  

When you feel too much and it blows up in your face

When she knows how to love but you don’t see a trace

Of love in her eyes

  

So why am I still here?

why am I still here?

why am I still here?

why am I still here?

  
  

What Love Is

How do you know when it’s time to give up when you’ve done all you can?

  
  

We know We know We know what love is

That’s not the point, the point _

  

How do you know when enough is enough when you’ve heard/hurt all you can

  
  
  

The Ones You Love

When you just can’t trust the ones who love you

Then what’s the point of all this love?

  
  

Ride Out The Waves

  

Wake up and live, it’s better then dying

Make up a smile or a sparkle; you’re not even trying

Show me the dream girl I met on the street

Full of life, love, and laughter in the face of defeat

  

Don’t let the water, drown out your flame

Your days will get better, let go of the shame

Let me help guide you; just hold on my hand

Together we’ll ride out these waves to the land

  
  
  

She’s a handful of sand that slowly slips through my fingers

  

So I will not abide her whimsy, I am not her fool

I’m not smashing empty vases

No more threats with empty razors

Trying desperately to reach her

Trying desperately to breach her 

Self-destructive defenses

Her Iron-clad fences

  

The pillars of sand

That rise up and stand 

protecting your heart

turned to glass and in part

keep the waves from destroying you 

but keep your soul from enjoying too

  

Sometimes it takes for someone to believe in you

  
  

Magic Moments

  

Your smile makes the problems seem so much smaller 

your eyes bring me back to life, back to reality 

you remind me to pause

to rethink

to breath 

and to love you again

  

a broken bike wheel

a ten minute giggle at the crosswalk

You'll cross on the next one 

You'll cross on the next one

You'll cross on the next one

I hope you never leave

  

mushy soup with pickles

and mayo on everything

  

forcing me to giggle when I’m mad

keeping me awake 

  

holding my hand in the streets when I shouldn’t be scared

kissing my thighs when I feel like a whale

  

watching strangers walk by, singing songs about ducks, wearing my dresses 

  

falling off bikes, mosquito filled hikes 

  

bus ride cuddles and naughty blankets 

  

bathroom rendezvous, filming your poo

What, you pick locks now? 

You’re wearing my socks now?

You’re trading in stocks now?

  

Leeches and beaches

6am wake ups, emergency shake ups

cake on your make up 

watching me sleep

holding your finger while you sleep

  

blood in the sheets, our fort is complete, need more tent poles to hold up the blanket

  

hide in the sheet when the world has depleted you

  

rinse out the dyes from the colorful eyes you throw me

  

kicked out of carts in the grocery store  ([wal]marts)

need to wear shoes, on almost every floor 

  

laugh at the sign no shoes no shirt no service

‘not him again’

  
  

the world makes sense with you by my side

no fears, or anxiety,  and no need to hide 

brainy talks and rainy walks

  
  

rollerblades wipe outs, close to getting hit

  
  

videos of me sweating at the gym

screeches of leeches when we go for a swim 

  
  

Love Fades Away

Love Fades Away

  
  

Let Me Go

You think you know someone well don’t

Chuck that wretched thought, or if you won’t

Then let me save you a whole __ of pain 

This people aren’t what they say

  

You thought that you knew me but you really didn’t know

What she’d do to you

Now you’re really low

  

Let me go, Let me go back where I’m from

  
  
  
  

Came For A Summer

You came for a summer, you stayed for a lifetime

And now that you’re here everything’s changed

And I don’t know who I am

And I don’t know where to go

Without you

So come on back and let us see

  

You are my _

You are my _

MARE’S POEM

First we sweat

Siyahamba, hamba

Then find me after your road trip 

at the stroke of midnight 

And we’ll play 

Space ship resonance

And thank god for our daily braid

With peanut butter 

And honey 

Spread slow 

It’s more like cake, really

  

  

you look like a movie star from this angle 

Cos you can rock anything 

Fearlessly 

I blush

I gush 

All three little MEs

slowly accepting that Its all sacred pink

Even the hospital bed

Especially that one

We want that one

twinkley lights

Stars and moons

Iridescence

Like the last’s piece of grape fruit

That you saved just for me

  

please Don’t take the edge off

disgusting 

we don’t want that

Ride it Like a centaur!

Dump the holiday nog!

But tread carefully 

Because two innocent lives can be saved

Practice silence 

Then spill your guts out

in cheeky Russian 

Or whatever. 

No wrong answers 

  

I do need more 

Than this modern world 

Tension, release, repeat.

I live for this shit 

But it’s all new to me

And I’m scared 

No running away. No putting up walls. No kicking anyone out.

Even when things change dramatically

Even if it’s a friggin Tsunami

Im off the deep end 

  

check in with me, often

Play me, unbridled 

Help me invite you in, gently 

Or have your higher self do it

  

  

Hold me.

  

  

Two of us on the run 

we’ve been around the block before

But this time it’s different

The path is too narrow to run

So Just sit with me

Om with me

Mirthfully

Blue eyes. You’re the secret I keep.

We are laughing fiends

Dancing evergreens 

Scored with mhmmms and dreamy vibes 

Scorpio rise

So touch my face

You dirty stinko 

Inhale me

I want you to 

But 

What’s OK & not OK?

Tension, release repeat 

  

In the meantime

Dream a little dream of me 

As soon as you wake up 

sniff my pillow

Send a red heart 

And I’ll smile. 

And sing you ABCD

Because that’s how magic works

Immaculately conceived 

Baby 

cow 

Baby

Millenial

Baby 

teeth

Coconut clean 

Great hair 

So Please- Be mine?

You are my sunshine 

Jai jai guru dun 

  

BABY COW

She wakes in a daze as the baby cow prays. Non-attachment and desire holding hands, sparking fire. Walk outside bring a blanket, hug a tree, should I thank it? Say farewell to the guests, birthday dinner of strangers,sit in snow, melt my heart, play pretend nothing changes.

Take a walk, walking slowly, colors pop, how you know me

  

I want you I want you I want you

  

No ID, we don't need it, warm our hands as you lead me in a role play we're strangers, feel the subwoofer, danger, pick me up, back to my place? Just jossing. But for real, now you're coming? Drinking tea, setting timers, can't express, what's that hiding? Gotta go? Now we're falling, it's a trap? Nah, its our calling 

  

Fuckin love ya. Fuck, I love ya. I love you. Kidding. Not kidding. 

  
  

COCONUT KISSES

Coconut kisses pull the gunk from our souls,

We birth a new era, floating far from our fears

Breaking ground, breaking, grounding, grinding,

Finding new ways of staying, splaying bare naked souls

Bodies writhing, we’re thriving on smiles and ecstatics

Dancing, thrashing, rehashing all the years that have happened since I saw you this morning

Yeah, we’re working, hardly working, being worked on,

Observing, deserving, we deserve to be happy, take the time to be present,

To be pleasant, you’re a gift, I give you, I’ll give to you, anything, everything. 

  
  

BROKEN

  

Get me out of this awful place  
Help me out here I’m broken  
Tell me how to get of here  
Help me out here I’m broken  
  

And I heave and I cry and I hope I die

And I’m steel till I break and I don’t know why 

  

And I’m tired of feeling broken

And I’m tired of not knowing 

And I’m tired of what’s left unspoken

When I’m feeling alone

  
  

We Found God

We found god

In all the darkest places

When we thought we couldn’t take no more

We found good

  

And I don’t wanna die, I don’t wanna die alone

I’m not ready to go

  

Just when we thought it was over now

Just when we thought we could take no more

Just when I thought I could count the stars

Turns out I was wrong

  
  
  

The Music Starts Again

Just when you thought it was over

When you couldn’t take no more

Just when you thought it was over

The music starts again

  
And when you fall 

The Sun will rise

And when you call me

I can never see the sky again

  
  

Surrender Mantra

I accept my path 

And embrace the greater vision

I believe in what's to come

I will not resist it

  

I'll step into my role

And trust the universe to guide me

Moving bravely through my fears

Everything I need's inside me

  

I accept my pain

And hold space for darker feelings

I will not avoid what's hard

The only way through pain is healing

  

I accept what is

And trust that there's a reason for it

Every hardship is a gift

And I will not deplore it 

  
  

Come On Home

  

And I can’t wait to come on home 

I can’t wait to let you know

I don’t know what we’ve been waiting for

And I can’t believe we could ever come so far

  
  

Show Me The Way Back Home

  

I’ve been sad for so long I forgot

What it’s like to be happy I thought I knew

How to find my way back home through the maze of life

Now I’m lost I can see I’m blind

  

Show me the way back home and I’ll come

Take my hand and we’ll run run run

Show me the way to be happy again

And watch over me, don’t let me fall asleep again

  
  

Daydream

  

Why can’t we all just daydream

  

Running in the Woods and never coming back

Running in the Woods and never coming back

  

Oh Moon

Oh moon, that glows up in the sky

Oh stars, shining oh so bright I see you

Thank you for your light 

For shining oh so bright

And guiding us this night

I thank you

  

I Can’t Believe 

(ideas)

  

I can’t believe we could live in a place so sweet

I never thought we could fin’lly see the trees could …

  
  

If I thought I couldn’t

(Sophia edited)

  

If I thought I couldn’t kiss you

If I thought I’d have to miss you

For the rest of my existence

I would lose my fucking mind

  

But as it stands tonight

I get to hold your hand

And if that changes

I’ll stop and let my tears drip into your eyes

Lashes crisscrossing 

Brushing softly against your thigh

Oh my….

  

If I thought I couldn’t dream beside you

I would roll over and never sleep

Just the thought of not feeling your body heat

Keeps me awake all night shivering

  

If I thought of all the things I couldn’t do when you’re dead

I’d wish for the moment to be over so I wouldn’t sit here and dread

The pain of feeling you missing

The pain of wanting to hold your hand

The pain of wearing your clothes to smell your body

The pain of hearing your ghost whisper in my mind

  

Of course the pain came much sooner

When you left me just this spring

And now all I’ve got is an empty house

You left the key and the ring

  

If I thought I couldn’t love you

My heart would break

Because that’s what’s keeping it beating

Despite the heartache

  
Let Go 

(voice memo)

We’ve finally let go

We’re finally set free

And we don’t know what’s coming up for us

  

Pray

You just pray, pray

Pray to all your gods and all the spirits watching over you

  

When the fates have spoken

When you’re cold and feeling broken

When you know you just can’t anymore

See the light at the end of the tunnel you just fall and pray

  
  
  

Witches Song 

(voice memo)

  

I never thought that it could end this way

I never thought that we could be this great

And now i know that we are here to stay

Oh god I love our witchy way

Oh god I love our witchy way

Oh god I love our witchy way

  

Found

  
  
  

Don’t Want To Leave Her Behind

  

And I don’t want to leave her behind

And I don’t want her feeling unkind

  
  

Banjo 

(Decemberists style)

  

when I saw her in the sky she was wearing no disguises

but when she landed on her feet all her colors were slightly pleated

  

how was I know that she was really hiding her scars(?)

Love is all around us

  

Love is all around us we just have to see

And not mistake the forest for the tree

  
  
  
  

Words are spells

Words are spells and you will cast them

So watch what you say, and think twice when cursing

  
  

Smiling back at me

There's magic in your eyes

And when I look you in the face I see you smiling back at me

And you don't even know my name

And I can't see a way through this

And I don't know where you could possibly find such joy in life

  

Youre special

I know you're special

I know that you've got greatness coming up for you

I know you're fueled by doing something special with you life

  

And I admire you for all you do

And I can see that there is nothing stopping you

  
  

Broken Bones

Loving partners feels like breaking all my bones, 

running into walls of brick again and again, 

they never seemed to set quite right, 

tried my best to be a doctor, but the text books don't suffice, 

trying something new each time, 

maybe broken bones feel better than mishappen ones, 

more reflective of how you feel inside, 

and every time you wonder, maybe this time will be the last?

  
  
  
  

Breathe deep

Breathe deep and feel the air 

let the winds in your hair remind to listen

  

Hold still, your body is speaking

It's desperately seeking to tell you

What you need to know

So please listen like your life depends on it

Because it does, yes it does

  

Breathe deep, dont judge your mind

Dont be defined, by what you've been thinking

  

Hold still, your body is speaking

It's desperately seeking to tell you

What you need to know

So please listen like your life depends on it

Because it does, yes it does

  

I Won’t Give Up On You

  

There's nothing I can say

To make anything ok

But I'll try

because what else can I do

  

I could not take care of you

You really needed me to

And god I tried

But I let you down

  

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I

And I will try to glue us back until the day I die

Though everything between us, needs time and care to heal,

I won't give up on you or how I feel

  

We sewed each others dreams

We were bursting at the seams

And god we tried

But we could not make it work

  

And I just disappeared

And nothing left was clear

And how you tried

But I just need more time

  

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I

And I will try to glue us back until the day I die

Though everything between us, needs time and care to heal,

I won't give up on you or how I feel

  

Broken, crushed by the weight of what's left unsaid

Taking a life, and watching your dreams crumble in your head

And I can only guess how hard it feels to feel alone

And nothing I can do can make it right

  

And here we are the pieces of what once was you and I

And I cant glue us back, but God you know i have to try

And only time will tell if it can ever truly heal,

But I will not give up on you

On My Mind

  

and you’re on my mind 

nearly all the time

and I don't know what the hell to do

every scent and sound and the sight of you reminds me of the way you've been on my mind

you've been on my mind

  

then you hold my hand

and I understand

what the universe has got in store

for the likes of us, who have come before

I've known you many times as you've been

on my mind

you've been on my mind

  
  

every scent and sound leads me back to you

  

If you only knew me

I've fallen down and I can't get back up again

I've tried a hundred times there's nothing left within me now

And if you only knew me back when I had a thousand stories in me

  

Now I spend my days in catatonic states of mind

Remembering when all the lucky stars aligned for me

Back when I was weird and wonderful

Full of life and willing to be wrong

  

How the times have changed now

How the colors fade out

How the world keeps turning even though it makes no sense

  

I was an artist with a million ideas

I conjured musics that our spirits longed to hear

I gave my life to telling stories that I had to share

I don't know who i am without them

How am I supposed to even care

  

I watch myself unravel everything that's wrong

There's extra pieces and I'm sure they don't belong here now

But who am I to cut them from my deck

Maybe they're just helping me reflect

  

How the times have changed now

How the colors fade out

How the world keeps turning even though it makes no sense

  

Im hope that someday I will get back up again

Shake off this winterlog and pick back up my pen and write all the thousand stories that I cried 

In the time I'd fallen down in spite of

  

How the times had changed now

How the colors fade out

How the world kept turning even though it made no sense

  
  

Is it me that you've been looking for

Is it me that you've been looking for?

I hear that life’s been knocking on your door

It's time

It’s time to let em in

  
  

Sing up our prayers

And we sing up our prayers

And we let down our tears

For the things we cannot fathom

That have touched upon our lives

  

And we say our goodbyes

As they lay in the ground

And we swear to remember 

All the ways they've touched lives

  
  

And the love never ends

Even though sometime we may pretend

As our worlds fall apart 

While we mend our broken hearts

  
  

And we say our goodbyes 

As they head for the skies

And our worlds are changed forever

Though we don't yet know just how

  

So we sing up our prayers

And we let down our tears

For the things we can't fathom

That have touched upon our lives

  
  

And we know we'll never see them 

But their memory lives on

  
  

Set me free

Show me the way, Teach me to pray

Help me to say, What’s been weighing me down

  

Open my mind, Help me be kind to me

I’ve been so resigned , To the way things were

it’s become a blur, It’s cold and dark here so

  

Set me free, From all the things 

That other people, Put, on me

  

Help me forgive myself, for all that I’ve lived where I for all the ways that I  / 

Didn't say no when it, Hurt so bad

  

All of the pain that I,  Suffered in vain when I

Could have just left, let it teach me now

Show me why and how, And let it leave me

  

Set me free, From all the things 

That other people, Put, on me

  

Let me go, and help me grow

It’s time I learned, how to be, alone

  

INTERLUDE

  

take me away, don’t let me stay here

I wasn’t made to be broken and sad

  

Help me revive my heart, I’m still alive, my god,

It’s time to thrive, and to shine my light

on the darkest night, And fill that cup so

  

Set me free, From all the things 

That other people, Put, on me

  

Let me go, and help me grow

It’s time I learned, how to be, alone

  

Where Did I Go Wrong?

Where did I go wrong 

When did I become a villain 

In the stories of their lives

When did all of our love die?

  

Emerging from the Dark

I’m lost in the darkness

The lights all go out

And the lines all surround

And I see in the darkness

  

And I can’t believe _ _ _

And I can’t believe _ _ _ 

  

I’m lost in the darkness

Couldn’t find my way upstairs

Then the lights all surround me 

Even though no-one cares

  

And I can’t believe what I’m seeing

And I can’t believe I'm alive again

  

I’m lost in the darkness

All the trouble come undone

And the night plays on madness

And light feels like fire

  

And I can’t believe what I’m seeing

And I can’t believe _ _ _

  
  
  

The doorways are open

Nevermind the way back home

Let the spirits surround us

And forget all you've known

  
  

Everything's Great

This is a song about how everything is great and even though we didn't make it, we'll just chalk it up to fate

I loved you and you loved me

But we couldn't find a way for us to be 

Happy 

But at least we tried

Kinda sorta, maybe we just let it die?

But I don't mind

I'll be fine 

And I won't even erase you from my mind

I'll be kind as I can

When I can

  

This is a song about how everything is fine, and even though it broke my heart I guess I'm glad we cut the line

I was hurting a lot 

And you're saying you were giving all you got

So why would we

carry on

Like some teenage lovers stuck inside a plot

Where you know 

how it ends,

But you still watch them get all tangled up in knots

So I guess I'm glad 

that we're not

Anymore

  

This is a song about how everything is wrong

And even though we had the feelings I just never could belong

In your world when I've got mine

There just never seems to be sufficient time

We've all got roles in each other's lives

And you trigger me to hell and back, that's fine

That's just your soul being kind

Helping me to heal the wounds I'd left behind

And I dont mind

I dont mind

I just wish it didn't leave me feeling blind

And it won't 

When I go into the light

  
  

After Ships Become Sunken Treasure

And it ends, another season

And it ends, another day

And in the end the things that mattered weren’t the ones you thought they would be 

  

Winter Cradle

??

  

??

I wake up each morning and I hope it's today

When I finally wake up feeling somewhat okay

  

And I've been in a daze for as long as I remember

And I feel like a crazy person falling to their Doon

  

Help me god 

To remember love

And to pray in ways

That I keep forgetting now

Show me please

All those fantasies
