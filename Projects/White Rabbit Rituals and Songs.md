        ii. It's easy to get lost in this magical world that you're

            > magic. You may even realise that there is magic within

            > offer it to them. There are many objects just waiting for
            > you to breathe life into them.

        v.  Some of the creatures in this world are quite shy, so we ask
            > that if you care for them, try to be aware of their needs.
            > Sometimes they need silence. If you stumble upon a group
            > of quiet beings, please be mindful.

        vi. As you wander, you may come across some magical and
            > forgotten places. Some of them are still alive. We
            > encourage you to make friends with them. Be gentle, but
            > don't be afraid to engage.

        vii. In your travels, you may encounter fragments of bark such
             > as this one. When the pieces come together, they create a
             > scroll that contains a powerful magic. We encourage you
             > to collect them, and bring them to the great portal. As a
             > collective, if we are able to find them all, we can cast
             > their spell tomorrow morning.

        viii. You have all been gifted a spellbook on arrival. Treat it
              > with care. In it you'll find not only information, but
              > in many ways a blank slate. As you discover magics in
              > this land, I invite you to collect them into your
              > spellbooks in whatever way works for you. They are all
              > medicine, and you never know when you might need them.

MAP OF MEDICINES

(word cloud)

THE 5 FIRES

Once upon a time there were 5 sisters. Quintuplets they were. Their
names were Body, Voice, Idea, Nature and Stillness.

Mother gave birth to them when she was very young. She was very scared
because she didn't know anything about raising children, and all her
friends said that it would be very hard.

Everyday Mother would leave the sisters at home and head to the forest,
hoping that she could forage enough food to feed them all. She didn't
want to be one of those mothers who neglects their children, but she was
very worried that she would not have enough food for them, and she
needed to focus on the work. She would work all day, and when she came
home, the sisters would be very hungry. They would cry "Mommy, can we
have some more?" but there never seemed to be enough.

One day Mother was looking particularly unwell, so Voice said "Mommy,
you need help. I'm coming with you today". Mother was reluctant, but
Voice was very insistent, and she really did need the help. They worked
together side by side, picking berries, singing songs.

The next day, as they were heading out for work, Mother and Voice
noticed that Body was following them. They tried to put her back in the
house, but Body just wouldn't stay. Reluctantly, Mother sighed and took
Body with her to work. The three of them danced through the forest,
singing and picking fruit.

The next day as they arrived at the forest, mother noticed Idea standing
there with a basket and a cart! "What are you doing here, Idea?" asked
Mother. She wanted to send her home, but it was too far to walk, and if
she was being honest, she needed all the help she could get. So the four
of them danced through the forest, picking berries, singing, and playing
word games

The next day, while they were picking berries, Mother slipped and fell
into a bush of stinging nettle. It burned and itched and she couldn\'t
focus on picking any more berries. Just as she was about to despair, she
saw Nature coming towards her, carrying some plantain leaf. "Nature!
What are you doing here?" Yelled mother. Nature smiled and rubbed the
plantain leaf all over mother\'s skin. Suddenly the itching and the
burning stopped! Mother couldn\'t believe it. It was like magic. The
five of them laughed and danced and sang, and swam in the lake, and
played games, talking about what they would do with their lives.

The next day was very hot. They set out for the forest to pick berries,
but by midday they were all exhausted. Mother was having trouble
concentrating, but she knew that she had to keep going or her children
would go hungry. Suddenly, she felt something tugging on her arm. She
looked around and saw Stillness! "Stillness, what are you doing here? I
have to work. Let go of my arm" but Stillness wouldn't stop. She kept
pulling and pulling, and then she pulled so hard that Mother fell over
and dropped her basket, and all her berries went rolling everywhere. At
first Mother was angry, but then she saw Stillness pick up one of the
berries off the ground. In her rush, Mother had accidentally picked
something very poisonous. They all took a break and sat by the shade of
a Juniper tree. Later when the sun had set and they were all refreshed,
they quickly picked all the berries they needed. Instead of going home,
they lit a fire and camped out under the stars

That night, Mother wondered why she kept going home all the time when
everything she needed was right here. She looked at the 5 sisters, and
beamed with pride. She hadn\'t realised how much time she was spending
away from them, picking berries. That moment, she promised to see the
forest for the trees. "You, the lights of my life, the fires of my soul.
My 5 fires."

EPIC POEM

Dearest humans

We, who had stood here for hundreds of years, thousands even, have
watched you for many generations. We've watched you come together, and
fall apart. We've seen you make the same mistakes over and over again,
and learn the same lessons. This is what we have observed.

Harmony is not about pitch. It\'s about resonance. When our voices ring
together, we attune ourselves to each other and the universe. (Toning)

Everything is singing to you, if you listen hard enough (Microwave)

The puzzle pieces fit together when you let go of expectations (Easel)

We all carry fires inside us; ideas, Sparks, inspirations, healings. If
we feed them wood that\'s had time to age and dry, they will burn
deeply, and profoundly. If we take our time, adding one log at a time,
they will burn safely, and keep us warm. If we let them breathe clean
air, circulating new ideas, then they won\'t suffocate themselves. If we
set them with intentions, they will burn the way we need them. (5 fires)

Everyone is leading and everyone is following. That is the nature of the
universe. Without one, the other is futile. (Flocking)

Silence is not about absence of sound, but presence of mind (Listening)

Our bodies tell us what we need, we just have to slow down enough to
listen (Body )

Asking for help, expressing gratitude, sublimation to the divine. These
are domains of prayer. Not words. Praying for your community. All my
relations (Prayer)

Trust is about knowing what to expect from someone, even if bad for you.
(popcorn)

You can\'t rush trust. Trust takes time. Over time, you will develop an
intuitive map of expectations. ()

When you try to force trust by making contracts, whether they be formal
agreements, or subtle manipulations such as social norms, you inevitably
cause harm.

If you listen to your body, over time you will learn to trust yourself.

If you try to force yourself to be something you\'re not, you will cause
harm.

Your body will tell you when it feels unsafe. Your mind will trick you.

Only you can hold yourself Accountable

Celebrate your mistakes. They are learning experiences. They help you
grow.

Say thank you often, and apologise sincerely.

An Abundance mindset is a belief that the universe will provide.

Life gives you what you need, and not necessarily what you want.

Scarcity is a fear tactic used to inflate prices.

A scarcity of time creates a false sense of urgency.

When time becomes money, you become a commodity

When you let go of the idea that people need to be \"useful\", you learn
to appreciate everyone just because they exist.

Connection is built on shared experiences

You will never feel alone if you remember that existence is an
experience we share with all people, animals, plants, the earth, the
universe.

You don\'t have to understand something to experience it.

Feelings can be uncomfortable, but discomfort is not the same as harm.

The fear, anxiety, and dread of feeling uncomfortable causes
significantly more grief than the experience itself

Discomfort teaches us about the world. It helps us grow.
