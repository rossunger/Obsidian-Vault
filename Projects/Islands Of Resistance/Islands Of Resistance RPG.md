Notes from Tallis
1)  Players each need, for character:
    a.  Name, Title, Role.
    b.  Vital issue in life?

Object: ?Make the Characters' lives touch on important issues, try to
understand the experience of being alive.

Specific metanarrative cause or reason for each game. --- Maybe decided
at a final, Dialect-Style Epilogue.

Put together specific narratively-relevant characters together for
specific games.

Identity (Queerness, Spectrum) Index.

To play:

Preperation:

Each player writes down a number (how many?) of Theme cards--- Themes
should be the vital, human issues you want to see in a game like this,
things like 'self-esteem', or 'slavery', or even 'hunger.' The more
specific, probably the better.

Then players (choose or draw a hand of actions?)\-- come up with
actions.

Draw a hand of (three?) characters, choose one, discard the others.
----?

Then play can begin, progressing in turns around the group:

Variant cards? Things like: Flashback to the preperations for this
moment, Jump forward to the conclusion of this moment, Zoom out to see a
grand effect, Zoom in to the human emotion, Draw next character card and
introduce them to the scene, figure out why they're there. --- Others,
see Itras By cards.

Variants can be used to modulate the flow and structure of the
improvised play, keeping the players on their toes and thinking in what
they want to see in the world. Can be used if anything stagnates.

The Flow of Play:

1)  Put down character (Draw?).

2)  Draw Theme for the turn (or perhaps have themes submitted by other
    > players? Player w/h turn it is chooses).

3)  Draw Action for the turn (or perhaps have Actions submitted by other
    > players? " " ").

4)  Answer Scene Prompt (Action Questions).

5)  Assign Thematic Roles of the Scene (draw extra character cards if in
    > need of inspiration?).

6)  Run a roleplayed scene using the prompts.

7)  :: Variant cards might come into play, changing the time flow of the
    > scene.

8)  Epilogue? Prompts for an epilogue would be interesting.
