*(lyrics by Sophia Bush Anderson)*

Here I'm looking at you just like I own you
Thinking of all the things that I want you to do
Then I catch your eye and smile
And remember a while
That you don't belong to me

I have to give you space so you can feel safe and free
I need to give you space so you can live independently
I give you space to breathe so you can make choices that are
not about me I give you space to breathe
So you can have autonomy

I'm walking with you holding on too tightly
Celebrating our love, but something's not right
I take a deep breath and Let go of your arm
Cos it turns out that I am suffocating you
Time to let go
So you can be you
And I can be me

I have to give you space so you can feel safe and free
I need to give you space so you can live independently
I give you space to breathe so you can make choices that are
not about me I give you space to breathe
So you can have autonomy

My actions have been kinda worrying
For you and your family and your friends
The media tells us love must be held tight
Even if you don't want it or if you put up a fight

I have to give you space so you can feel safe and free
I need to give you space so you can live independently
I give you space to breathe so you can make choices that are
not about me I give you space to breathe
So you can have autonomy

I guess I'm learning that love doesn't have to hurt
We can live separate lives, love isn't measured by our
Our obsession, or control,
Or how hard we refuse to let each other go
You can be you
I can be me

I have to give you space so you can feel safe and free
I need to give you space so you can live independently
I give you space to breathe so you can make choices that are
not about me I give you space to breathe
So you can have autonomy
