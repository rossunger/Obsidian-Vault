-   Police racism: Joee Smith story\...

-   STORMS notes: a couple of further thoughts stemming from canvassing
    > conversations:

> 1\) a lot of folks around Uniacke Square and the Gottingen area more
> generally are very concerned with violence in the community, which is
> very much on the rise right now as we\'re probably all aware. I\'ve
> noticed that many people aren\'t answering their doors after dark
> these days. If we can work this issue into the overall narrative folks
> will likely appreciate it. an obvious starting point for connecting
> the issues (for me) would be to note that gentrification intensifies
> poverty conditions, damages community ties, and increases isolation
> and competition. All of which leads to increased conflict, crime, and
> violence. That\'s sort of simple and shallow, but not a bad starting
> point IMO.
>
> 2\) also in relation to violence- some people are very upset with the
> police. many folks in the gottingen area often feel that the police do
> not take them or their problems seriously. in general, a lot of people
> have a sense that the government is either neglectful of, or actively
> hostile towards, the community
>
> 3)vague rumours continue to circulate regarding plans by the municipal
> or provincial gov\'t to sell Uniacke Square. This is almost always
> expressed in relation to condos/gentrification ie \"pretty soon
> they\'re just gonna sell this whole place and turn it all into
> condos\" speaking to very serious and probably well founded anxieties
> about the future of the neighbourhood.
>
> 4)concerns around maintenance, repairs, and a the lack or poor quality
> of various services (snow removal, recreational activities for kids)
> are very common in NS public housing. People will often segue from
> talking about gentrification to talking about deteriorating conditions
> in public housing- ie \"that\'s why they\'re letting this place fall
> apart, they\'re just gonna sell it in a couple of years, look at
> this\"
>
> 5)some community members who have been active around this issue
> (members of ACORN and the Brunswick Street Tenants Association) have
> adopted the analysis that gentrification represents \"social
> cleansing\", ie the removal of \"undesirable\" elements from the city.
> On this analysis, gentrification is not only an economic process, but
> a process of social policing aimed at producing a more homogenous
> community basically consisting of white yuppies and hipsters.
>
> 6)lastly, we\'ve had a few really enthusiastic responses. some folks
> are lukewarm on the issue, but folks who are aware often get really
> fired up really fast.

Why doesn\'t anyone understand me

Will I make any friends

~~\*\*\*This is what it feels like to be the minority for once\*\*\*~~

**SCENE X**

> *Police HQ. Police Chief's office*

**Constable:** You wanted to see me?

**Chief:** Detective, take a seat.

> (pause)

> What would you say are the biggest problems facing the force today?

**Constable:** You have the report right there. Mental health and
suicide, \_\_\_, \_\_\_.

**Chief:** Mmmm. Do you agree with the report?

> *Constable doesn't know how to answer tactfully*

**Chief:** You don't have to answer.

> I've been here 5 years, and I feel like I've only scratched the
> surface. You've been here...?

**Constable:** My whole life.

**Chief:** I can tell. I can see the way you deeply care about your
community

**Constable:** Is that why you promoted me?

**Chief:** #halifax police has more diversity than most police forces in
Canada

> #humans can only actively remember 150 people\...I want to remember
> you. Will you help?

...

**Constable:** Are you sure it's not because I'm black?

**Chief:** It doesn't hurt

**Constable:** Uh...

**Chief:** What would you publicly state are the main issues facing the
force?

**Constable:** Corruption, racial discrimination, and community
relations\...

> Which are all really the same thing.

**Chief:** Even though you've seen the stats?

**Constable:** Stats are just numbers on a page. Not everyone speaks in
numbers.

> And numbers lie. #Some people are invisible to numbers

~~**Chief:** You're going to spend \_ because of a few crooked cops?~~

~~**Constable:** There more than a few. And it's not just the cops.~~

**SCENE X**

> *City council town hall. Steph pitches selling the square.*

**Chorus:** But some will run aground when the system holds you down

> *The two north ends, the two "town halls"*

SONG: Gentrification song (referencing instances of gentrification
around the world)

**X:** Gentrification, Gentrification

Urban renewal and revitalisation

**X:** (spoken) the merriam-webster dictionary defines gentrification
as:

> "the process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of
> middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often
> displaces poorer residents"

**A:** We weren't deteriorating until they \_\_\_\_.

**X:** The Oxford dictionary defines gentrification as

> "The process of renovating and improving a house or district so that
> it conforms to middle-class taste."

**A:** Damn white people

**B:** White people?

**A:** Yeah. They're the ones who did this to us.

**B:** What, all white people

**A:** Yeah. All of them.

**B:** What about Jarred. He's white

**A:** He ain't white, he's from Australia. That's different. He ain't
from here.

> I mean Scotian white.

**C:** Don't you mean rich people?

**A:** Yeah, them too. But they're all white.

> And I ain't talking about the color of their skin. I mean up here.
>
> *He points to his head*

**B:** What do YOU know about this gentrification

**A:** What do I know? I know everything.

...

> Gentrification, Gentrification
>
> What do we do about this "gentrification"
>
> ...
>
> What's next? Where does it end?
>
> Integration is a 2 way street
>
> ...
>
> *Alternating between the Devin and Chance talking about
> gentrification.*

**Devin:** People move in, people move out, things change

**Chance:** My mom lives here, and that's my uncle over there.

> And that's \_\_ over there, we're not related, but he's like a
> brother. And the Daye's live over there\...that's Candace... and
> that's Gilbert.

**...**

**Devin:** It's simple. Poor artists move in because an area is cheap.

> They make art, which makes the area desirable, which raises the
> property values, which means the artists can't afford rent, so they
> find a new cheap area and so on. It's actually a beautiful process.
> Everyone has a role, and overall society benefits.

**Chance:** It's simple.

> They take a nice, black neighborhood, usually black, and they
> introduce crack cocaine. And when I say they, I mean the police and
> the government, cos they're the ones responsible for this. It's not
> like they don't know where the crack is. Why do you think the crack
> ends up in this community? Same reason all the VLTs are down this way.
> Same reason that there's no grocery store. They want us to destroy
> ourselves. And you can see it - now that the community is broken,
> they're coming in and cleaning it all up. You don't see dealers on
> every corner anymore. Why didn't they do that 15, 20 years ago? And
> this isn't the only place that's happened. Every hood in the states
> that you hear about has a similar story.
>
> buy, sell, repeat.

**X:** Where do you think the crack comes from?

> You don't think they know that?
>
> There's a reason it all ends up here.
>
> **\...**

**SCENE X**

> *~~Centreline Studio. Chance is in a wheely chair with his back to the
> door. Enter Kate.~~*

~~**Chance:** \_\_\_~~

> *~~Kate is startled.~~*

~~**Kate:** You scared the shit outta me. They let you out?~~

~~**Chance:** You know they set me up. I've done shit, but this wasn't
me.~~

> ~~Why would I lie about that? They set me up.~~
>
> ~~#they got their eyes on me\...psychological trauma... emotional...
> if they knew how them being here affects me they wouldn't do it.~~

~~\...~~

> *~~Chance gets a text. \[introduce Chance's delivery business\]~~*

\...

SONG: ...

**Kate:** What can I do? How can I help? I am just a high school teacher

> What do I know? How can we save the square?
>
> There is nothing we can do.

...

**Chance:** Gentrification is a part of history

> Which means it's also, kinda of a mystery
>
> But why would someone else want to do this to me?
>
> Why would they want to destroy my community?
>
> this place is more than just reality to you and me
>
> And this place can still become, everything it was supposed to be
>
> A home for me and you that we can share equally
>

[How To Explain The Storyline.]{.underline}

1)  We see gottingen st, the square, all the characters in our show.
    > Some of them are real people, some of them are made up based on a
    > combination of real people

    a.  We have **Kate** who runs a dance studio, and is trying to unite
        > the community by putting on a musical. She is also a spoken
        > word poet/Activist who is trying to organise protests

    b.  We have **Pastor Britton**, preaching sermons at the Cornwallis
        > Baptist Church. She's a narrator type figure.

    c.  We have **Chance**, just out of prison, he's trying start up a
        > rehabilitation program, using his skills in the drug trade to
        > set up a food delivery service for the community. He's also a
        > producer at centreline, the community recording studio

    d.  We have **Nate**, a rich white kid whose parents divorced and
        > now he's living in the square with his mom.

    e.  We have Nate's Dad, **Devin**. He's a big shot developer trying
        > to "revitalise" the neighbourhood.

    f.  We have Devin's new wife, **Steph**. She's a politician with a
        > bit of white saviour syndrome. She believes in the work Devin
        > is doing, but as she get's to know the neighbourhood, she
        > realises their mistake.

    g.  We have **Lindell**, a young politician from the square who's
        > struggling with the fact that he only has so much time and
        > can't help everyone.

    h.  We have **Mama K**, the community mama who hosts lunches, and
        > gets people out of trouble\...the police all know her and she
        > can stand up to authority.

    i.  We have a certain **Constable** that is well loved in the
        > community. His struggle is seeing the dark side of his
        > community and wanting to help, but his job requires him to
        > criminalise people.

    j.  We have the **Police Chief** who starts to realise how much he's
        > failing the black community after he's on a panel discussion
        > about violence in the community.

    k.  We have Andy Graff, a **cop** who's anti-graffiti, essentially

        > who sucks at school, one is a great dancer who is trying to
        > become a **Sex worker**, one is an **Entrepreneur** involved
        > with a certain community garden initiative that's doing quite

        > many kids in her class and not being able to help them all.

    o.  We have **Tyler**, who works at the school supporting kids like

        > for low-income families.

    p.  We have cameos from **eddie**, **sobaz,** or actors playing
        > them.

2)  The community discover that the government is selling the square,
    > and everyone reacts in different ways:

    a.  "Everything sucks, and it's all white people's fault"

    b.  "This is awful. Let's riot and set the streets on fire!"

    c.  "Everything sucks and there\'s nothing we can do, but I'm stuck
        > here"

    d.  "It's hopeless. Let's move to another area"

        > etc"

    g.  "This is none of my business, I don\'t have time to think about
        > it"

    h.  "These changes are great. I love all the new restaurants"

    i.  "This is an exciting opportunity. Let\'s buy up land and
        > revitalise this place."

3)  As the stories unfold, we have lots of different events:

    a.  Scenes in a new shop\...security guard following around these
        > black girls and they get mad at him for racial profiling, a
        > sign on the bathrooms that says "bathrooms are for paying
        > customers only", somebody applying for a job and changing
        > their names so that it doesn't "sound so black"

    b.  Scenes at school... kids talking about shades of black/skin
        > color, a kid who's never seen vegetables grow in the ground,
        > new condo's next door to the school shooting it's underground
        > carpark exhaust into the playground, parent begging teacher to
        > keep her kid in "french immersion" because all the delinquent
        > kids are in the english stream, and they don't want their kid
        > to be like that, pre-teens mimicking their older siblings who
        > are involved with human trafficking

    c.  Scenes in the streets... ex-gangstas delivering groceries and
        > getting police checked, kids graffiti-ing and encountering sex
        > workers for the first time, street engaged youth singing about
        > bigotry, Steph trying to get people to "beautify" their spaces
        > by planting flowers and realising that people don't want that,
        > a giant uniacke sq mural with consent from home owners,
        > Constable catches young Sexworker

    d.  Government Scenes\...protestor rocking up with bags of dead rats
        > they collected from a recently public housing, Lindell
        > fighting for the square,

    e.  Community gathering scenes... BBQ, street party, dance, church
        > sermon about gentrification, panel discussion with police
        > chief, funeral for recent gun violence victim, an occupy
        > protest, Performance of the musical which is attended by Devin
        > because his son is in it

4)  Here are some songs that we've brainstormed:

    a.  Welcome to Squaretown

    b.  Gentrification 101 (that's how it's done)

    c.  The Two North Ends (and Two Town Halls)

    d.  Song of Privilege

    e.  White saviour song

    f.  Keys To Power

    g.  Monopoly song

    h.  In my dreamland

    i.  Dirty Little Secret (where are all the black people at?)

    j.  Africville lament

    k.  Pick your battles (can't win them all)

    l.  Destined for greatness.

    m.  Why do I have to go to school?

    n.  What is Hip Hop (It's a way of life)

5)  The show ends with a song that asks "How do we define success?",

Lindell doesn't have enough time to sing... starts to sing and then
remember that he's busy

We never locked our door

Mackarell... a dollar would feed a family of 7 kids

Kids playing in the street

It takes a village to raise a child

There's a stigma on this community

It's about working moms and dads, they're trying to raise their children

Let's get some facts

There's more of us than there is of you (yuppie said this to someone
fighting against gentrification)

I paid my taxes\...and now I'm an invalid and I need help, is there
anything wrong with that?

How is 600/month affordable when you only get \$535 for rent assistance?

They're telling us "oh you're so entitled"

We're talking about doing the right thing!

Bring it back to the people

Direction 180, where will they put their van?

Church next to SJAM, goosebumps when I walk past there\...it's
sacrelige...I've buried people there. I've seen weddings, and
christenings, there's a history to that place.

People are tough\...people are survivors in this community

I don't want it to all fall apart when we die\...I don't want people to
forget

Mikmaw perspective??

Idea: project this film onto municipal buildings

Housing gets money to make the outside look pretty

Start riots to bring the land value down

We looked after our seniors\...we made sure they were fed, we did their
laundry\...we had their clothes in our backyards, we HAD backyards!

#Harbor city homes+

It's home

Memories you don't want to give up

It scares the heck outta me

I'm all for change, I just don't want to see my history wiped out.

Charity begins at home

Not everyone is on assistance here. Most of us are working poor, living
cheque to cheque. It's very expensive to poor. You can't buy anything in
bulk, and

People are looking for work outside the neighbourhood

Jingling change purses\...mackerel

The Builders Pespective:

What is it like to be the hands that build these buildings that put
people out of house and home? Remorse? Possibility to change? Boycotting
the developers?

#LANCE's perspective:

Africville, beautiful community. Somewhat "rundown", but loved, and nice

Garbage dump comes, people scavenge

Africville destroyed

Split up, some taken to a concrete jungle - the square.

80/90s... a whole new community was built, and that's MY life. That what
I got to see. I didn't see what happened to africville, but I felt it. I
feel it right now. I got to see what happened AFTER that...

People were hurting, they just wanted to get fucked up. People learned
skills by hand, but didn't have the papers, so they couldn't a job, so
they were forced to get into drugs, prostitution, crime. They were
hurting. That's what creates poverty

I was high enough up the chain to see who the big drug funders
were\...they own construction companies, they own manufacturing plants,
they're politicians

What happens next is mass incarceration. It's a big profit for the
government. People were getting 2 years for a \$20 \[crack\] stone.

People coming out of prison, having an impossible time. Trying

IDEALIST ENDING:

Everything comes together, people start new businesses

REALISTIC ENDING:

Your life gets disrupted constantly and you end up back in jail

Because of everything I've been through in my life, I feel like I'm
constantly in danger.

Ty: I stayed out of trouble... Memorise undercover license plates...
swimming through it....you can\'t avoid it. When it rains, you swim...
Chance was like an umbrella.

#positive sexworker character... guiding / discouraging Cecilia

#the square is more than property. It's family, it's the people, to see
kids playing in a park - that's such a rarity now.
