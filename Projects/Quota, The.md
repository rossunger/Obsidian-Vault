### SYNOPSIS

5 bureaucrats are selecting a final candidate to fill the immigration
quota for the year. They have shortlisted 5 potential people, with the
"obvious" choice being Bill, the billionaire. However, through the magic
of "empathy" they experience what it is like to BE each immigrant, and
begin to question everything.

### OTHER CONCEPTS

An interactive experience where audiences are trying to immigrate to our
country. We are processing their application. We invite them to assess
each other's applications based on a set of criteria we have designed.
We invite them to design new criteria for selecting immigrants

### WORLD
There is only one wealthy country left.

Many people want to migrate there because of Wars, Famines, Natural
disasters, Poverty, Cultural and Political persecution, and various
other reasons.

    -   why are these specific 5 bureaucratic characters in this job?

-   Where are the immigrant right now? Internment camp on an island?

-   Padre

    -   Welcoming strangers with open arms, despite differences...
        > embracing differences... symbolises the fact that xenophobia

-   Quincy will research term "Immigration"

**Main Philosophical Message -- Concept**

When the fire starts in a forest all animals run for survival.

When the food is at scarcity -- animals move to better spots.

It is a reflection of the Universal Right of the living creatures to
survive.

Same applies to humans. We all have natural right to live a good life.

So people are by birth granted the freedom of eating well, developing
talents, recreating without fear, expressing ourselves etc.

From this moral point of view migration is absolute legitimate activity
of humans.

The problem is in developed countries capable to save those not very
fortunate people.

Governments of the World pretend to exercise high moral however when it
comes to sacrificing the material wealth they create various barriers.

By taking the migrants developed countries risk to diminish existing
wealth, shift balance of religious and cultural foundations.

On personal level it is different. Although not everyone but plenty of
lucky citizens would open their doors and share what they have with
starving, sick, scared people. That will make them feel good!

There are some benefits for the countries taking migrants. Increasing
population leads to growing consumption and growth of economy. It takes
time however.

Smart countries discriminate. They prefer to take talented and educated
people because their contribution in economy typically is higher.

That is why governments create Categories (could be a great satirical
song!).

Professional migration, business migration, family re-unions and the
least desirable -- refugees.

There are voices of ~~irresponsible~~ people who ask for more humane
position for migration.

Of course it is easy to blame government but who will pay the bills?

"More migrants -- less money for education, health and army!" - but is
this actually true?

If we really want to stay for higher moral -- we need to agree to
sacrifice some of our wealth.

"One of the new ways should allow for personal sponsorship where
wealthier individuals will be able to nominate and fully support
migrants." - this already exists in "spousal/family" sponsorships, and
is SUPER discriminatory. Also, this would put too much power in the
hands of the wealthy. Who are they to decide who is allowed into the
country.

***In the world today there are 65 million displaced people - including
21 million refugees -- largely as a result of ongoing conflicts in the
Middle East, Africa, Asia.***

**Objectives:**

Raise awareness of the struggles that face immigrants/refugees. Show the
shortcomings of "nationalism" vs "egalitarian" world-view

-   Policy change in australia? Canada? The world

-   Increase in political engagement/resistance on immigration issues

Stakeholders

-   Immigrants

-   Refugees

-   Government

-   Public

**Target Audience**:

-   Immigrants?

-   Politicians?

-   Xenophobes?

-   Islamophobes?

-   People who live everyday lives without thinking about immigrants and
    > refugees?

**Theme Ideas**

-   Immigrants are people too? :P

-   "Evil triumphs when good men do nothing"

-   "Xenophobia leads to inhumane acts"

-   "Xenophobia dehumanises us all" OR "Inclusion and diversity makes
    > humanity thrive"

-   Categories - rules put candidates into the matrix, so you are not a
    > human any more (Russian game "pyatnashki" - move 15 squares to
    > sequence them in order in the matrix of 16 spots)

**Relevant Issues**

-   The refugee situation in Syria

-   Australia's inhumane Refugee policy... camps in papua new
    > guinea\...Manus Island

    -   Protests happening outside about the refugee camps

-   Trump and xenophobia

-   Africa refugee camps

    -   We worked with one kid last year who has spent 12 years in a
        > refugee camp in africa! (he was only 16 years old!) He was SO
        > grateful to be in canada

-   "Mail order brides"

    -   You have a good contact for this I think? :)

**SCRIPT**

**PROLOGUE (short... 2-3 minutes, no "song")**

> *Christmas time. Little girl (young betty) is upset about something
> (what? Maybe they were poor and didn't have any presents this year? Or
> maybe they got a very cheap present?).*

**Parent:** Close your eyes. Close them. Please? Do it for me? It can be
my christmas

> Present?
>
> *She closes her eyes*

**Parent:** This is is something my grandmother taught me.

> It's some seriously powerful magic. It can make you feel things you've
> never felt before. Ok. You ready? So. You are bird. You are flying
> through a forest. You are feeling hungry. You see a little
> caterpillar, and you fly towards it, ready to pounce... you close your
> eyes, and you feel a wave of energy roll through you. Now, suddenly,
> YOU are that little caterpillar. You look around, and you see a giant
> bird flying straight at you! It is terrifying. You know you're about
> to die. You think of your family. You wonder how they will survive
> without you. You try to scurry away, but you know it's not use. Only a
> miracle can save you now. You close you eyes and ask for help. Once
> again, you feel a wave of energy roll through your body. You open your
> eyes, and you are the bird once more. Now that you have seen as the
> caterpillar sees, thought as the caterpillar thinks, felt as the
> caterpillar feels, (something about using your imagination to
> empathise with others, and learning to care about people you don't
> know by putting yourself in their shoes)

**Overture**

Show videos, photos, relevant facts (text):

65 Mil displaced people, 30 Mil willing to migrate for better life,
Hungary builds the fence, US cancelled the refugee programs etc

-   Reference: love actually opening sequence/closing sequence

**Parent:** Now picture this-

> *Cut to the opening scene*

**OPENING**

SONG: Dot your i's and cross your t's #Bureacracy song: A well oiled
machine

> *Everyone is stamping forms rhythmically.* #Betty is the black
> sheep\...super empathetic. *Betty picks up a pen and ticks a box.
> Everyone freezes and stares at her.*

**Betty:** They just forgot to tick the box

> *As the song ends, our 5 bureaucrats make their way to Art's office*

**Art:** My colleagues, the year is about to end.

> I want to thank you very much for all your work. We practically
> fulfilled our quote on this year\'s intake of migrants and it is
> because of your heroic efforts. Now we need to select a candidate for
> the last remaining spot in in the program.
>
> Out of all the applicants we compiled a shortlist of 5 most suitable
> subjects. Everyone of them went through thorough background check. We
> also considered their personal circumstances and compared with other
> candidates. So there are no doubts any of them can be granted a right
> to move into our glorious country.
>
> What we need to do now is review their situations again and select the
> most suitable applicant. I think the honour should be given to the
> candidate who potentially help future development of our society, fit
> easier into our cultural values and present the smallest burden on the
> government budget.

**Betty**: Mr Chairman but shouldn't we also consider individual
situation of the applicants?

Some people are desperate and really need help.

**Dan:** Honey, it's Christmas. Do you really want to spend your
afternoon deliberating over 5 equally good candidates when you could be
going home to your fella

**Betty's** song - internal (soliloquy)

I'm not your honey

And there ain't no fella

And my private life is not for you to comment on.

...

And one day I'm gonna find a way to say all this to you\...

**Art:** Hello? Off with the fairies again, are ya?

**Betty:** What? Oh. Sorry

*Art gives her a look (what kind of look?)*

**Art:** So, if there's no objections, shall we get this show on the
road? All in favor of Bill? Great-

**Betty:** Wait.

> *Everyone sighs.*

**Betty:** I'm sorry. I can't. I know it's christmas and you all want to
get home, but this doesn't feel right. Can we just, spend a few minutes,
actually looking at these people? Treat them like human beings, and not
some abstract form? Here, I'll help you. Close your eyes.

> *2 of them close their eyes*

**Betty:** Close them.

> *1 more closes their eyes*

**Betty:** Please? It won't take long. Consider it my christmas present?

> *Art concedes, and closes his eyes. Betty picks up the first file*

You're talking

> *TRANSITION into Billionaire\'s office. We hear protesting outside.
> Enter Advisor.*

**Bill:** What do they want now?

**Son:** Well, they're on strike, poor working condition, low pay

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Bill:**   Everybody wants a handout. Well, they're barking up the
              wrong **tree**. You don't become a billionaire by wasting
              your money on the whims of your emplo**yees.** I'm paying
              them market value, if they don't like it, they can go work

*SONG: something about Family, Art realising that these are also his

**Art:** I always thought I knew

My path, my trail to life

But what I didn't realize was

What I'd leave behind when I retired.

The empty chair I'll leave

I didn't care who'd fill it

But now I know my heart is whole

Both here and with my wife...

Bri, he's like a brother.

Dan he's like a son.

Betty she's a fiery thing

And God, I see the future in her

Gladys has been here with me since I was 21

I didn't know

> Quite like this.

**ART/PADRE story**

Art is looking forward to going home for xmas. He's lived a long full
life, and now he's ready to relax and spend quality time with his
family. In reality, his family doesn't have very much time for him, and
he'll probably be bored and lonely, but he doesn't know this yet.

**Art**: Soon I will retire to my country house.

> Work in the garden growing these petunias.
>
> What can be better than that after so many years of hard work?
>
> Meanwhile the family will gather at the table, nice presents for the
> kids and grandchildren, laughter, food - life is good!
>
> I put the work in, I deserve my rest
>
> \...
>
> \...
>
> Now the only question is, who will take my place?

...

Padre cherishes every moment with his family, because he knows that life
is fleeting and that any moment could be the last.

**Padre:** I must be most lucky man

> To feel this every day

As refugees kids from the next village arrive, he adopts them as his
own, and gets them to help out on his farm.

...

Art realises that his co-workers are also his family, and that he's
going to miss them. He reveals that he is secretly afraid of retiring.

...

Padre adopts everyone in need. Even an old man, he imagines this man as
his father, even though they don't speak the same language, and have
different cultures.

...

Art feels an intense connection with the immigrants whose lives they
just experienced. He realises that family extends across borders and
cultures.

#doing nothing is an act of violence\...

...

Padres village is destroyed. He ends up in a refugee camp.

...

Art finally agrees to break the rules.

**DAN/TOOSA story**

Dan is excited about the promotion that he thinks he's going to receive.
His life is going according to plan.

...

> *Toosa's body is buried in the sand. He is trapped. There is a juice
> box with a straw just out of reach of his mouth. He periodically tries
> to reach it with his tongue*

**Toosa:** Out here you only survive if you're useful.

> And you're only useful if you're strong, or smart. And I was never
> very strong. And I don't mean body strong. I mean the "look someone in
> the eyes as you shoot them strong".
>
> #My usefulness was running out, so I did the onl
>
> This kind of torture is reserved for
>
> #at least they left me a hat.

...

Dan tries to dominate the debate over which immigrants should be picked
to impress his boss (Art). He ends up behaving inappropriately towards
Betty and gets very defensive. It completely backfires.

...

Toosa wakes up in a cave. He is alive but very injured. The Matriach
tells him the stories/teachings of her people. He scoffs at them

\...

Dan talks to Art about Betty

Art agrees, but recommends against romances in the office.

\...

Toosa, now able to walk again, sees the rest of the village. He sees how
beautiful it is, everyone working together, no violence. He was upset
about the idea of wearing a dress at first, but now that he sees every

**SHAIA/GLADYS**

Gladys is an anxious human. She tries to be invisible, just do her job
and go home. She has low self esteem.

...

Shaia is bored. She's bought all the trinket she can from the market,
and watched all the TV show she can handle. She's sick of being
isolated. Being a dictators wife sucks. She overhears her servants
talking about a crafting club and decides to sneak away and join them
anonymously.

...

Gladys joins a female empowerment club to feel more support. She has
always had decent men in her life, and is shocked to hear the stories of
some of the other women who have been abused. She realizes that men and
women need each other to have balance, and realises she's been pushed
around by men her whole life and just assumed that that was okay and
normal. She enjoys complaining with them.

...

Shaia arrives at the crafting club and is surprised by how everyday
people experience life. She struggles at first, but eventually gets the
hang of it. She discovers that this group comes together to complain
about her husband, the dictator. She enjoys complaining with them.

...

Gladys embarks on a quest to bring power to women in her life. She is
scared of angering the men in her life, though, or of standing up for
herself at all, but she feels like she can do it for other women. When
Betty takes a stand against the 3 men, she feels the strength to go
along with it.

...

Shaia discovers that the crafting group is planning to overthrow the
dictator. She is scared and conflicted. She wants to run and warn him,
but also dreams of a life outside the restrictions of her husband and
her country. She wants to be an astronomer and pursue science, and her
strong desire allows her to flee the country before the revolution
begins.

...

Gladys is talking to her women club during the meeting even a group
call. She's asking them what to say, etc. very funny. It turns out that
she is great with computers, and the group uses her to hack the system
to let all 5 immigrants enter.

**BETTY/INDI**

Betty has big ideas, but is finding it hard to make people listen. She's
determined to succeed against all odds.

...

Indi is studying for an important exam, but all she can think about is
some guys that she met online. She laments that her parents never let
her have time for romance.

...

...

We discover that all these people Indi is meeting are actually applying
to have her as a mail order bride. Her parents threaten that if she
leaves the country, they'll never speak to her again.

**(What if we start with the Xmas party in the department. All business
is done for the year. Decision on Applicants is taken. Now it is time to
relax. *For the Author - good chance to set up the characters*.) - what
is the benefit of framing the show inside this flashback?**

Everyone with Champagne glasses.

**Betty**: Oh, I love Xmas. It reminds me about the childhood dreams,
Xmas tree, Carols, presents. It is so lovely to experience a mood of
fairy tail again.

**Dan**: Yes, Xmas is wonderful time, luxurious holiday somewhere on the
island with a warm ocean, lovely beach, sand.. Betty I booked tickets
for 2 - why don't we go together and have a good time?

**Bri**: I love Xmas because it is about time for my shares to bring
dividends. Money is like seeds you plant and nurture to get the fruit
later. It is a great feeling then they bringpleasing to get. I won't
spend anything for silly things. I just want my capital to grow.

**Gladys**: Actually Xmas is not a good time for me. Lonely again in my
condo. Reading a book and having occasional glass of wine. All these sad
evenings at the TV.

> *There is a conference table as a main decoration. 5 members of
> committee enter and take their chairs. Art opens the meeting.*

**SCENE X**

**SCENE X**

**SCENE X: Finale**

Dan: How do we choose? This is impossible

Gladys: We let them all in

Art: What?

Bri: We can't do that

Betty: Why not?

Art: Because we have a quota. We have a mandate

Gladys: Screw your mandate! These are people's lives we're talking.

...

Art: You're right. What do I have to lose. I'm retiring.

Bri: And I'll probably be dead by the time anyone finds out.

**STAGING IDEAS**

The five clerks sit in office chairs on wheels... when one of them
"transforms" into immigrant, they stand and propel their chair
backwards, and the others just wheel away.

Betty invites audience to close their eyes too when imagining the
immigrants... could be useful for scene transitions

**SONG IDEAS**

"You may feel small, but you hold their lives in your hands"

"You can't help everyone" "doesn't mean you shouldn't try"

Art feeling like his staff is his "work family", lamenting retirement,
saying goodbye to everyone.

"They're condemning us... / us and them-ing us"

Application for migration

Love us, respect us, beware of us

Soldiers fight and shoot to keep the peace of the country

Cafes serve coffee to keep the comfort of people

Engineers design machines to make work easier

Builders make houses for the people to live

And only Public Servants invisibly work

To keep all the life rolling

And no one knows what they are doing exactly

**ref**

We know the rules

We have a Mission

We check, we sign, we stamp, we file

With no omission

2.We decide who is worth being with us

We decide who is worth a dole

We decide who can sleep under the bridge

*(Melbourne council recently decided to forbid rough sleeping in CBD)
**- ! I know!! It's crazy. ***

We have a great power on people's lives

Politicians think that they make the laws

But it is us to apply the law

Love us, kow tow to us, beware of us!

Application for government housing (stamp)

Application for new development (stamp)

**Category Song**

**v1.** When God created the Earth he forgot to make categories

All people were mixed and the big mess began

Thanks to our wise Government we have categories now

And this became a foundation for the Order

***ref:***

Fat goes into cell A1

White into B5

Catholic into C3

Uni graduate into D2

Alcoholic into E77

Dog lover into F0

Gay into G9

Convict Z9

Activist into Z7

Rich into H1

**v2.** People belong to their category like to a cell the the matrix

They can never move into another cell

Imagine the game of Chess where figures can move

The way they like!

We cannot allow for that

So we do a big job

We analyse, we classify, we categorise, we normalise, objectify - we
build the order

Without the order nothing can be achieved

***ref:***

**v3.**Sometimes people do not fit into a category

To save the situation we create ANOTHER one

We find a cell for those without one

Because no one can live without the category

Category makes them feel right

It gives people certainty

They know where they belong

Category, category, category

**Hali Song (Betty puts on a scarf)** *Sad and Tender*

V1.

Is it a sin to love a girl?

I was born in a loving family

My parents gave me everything

They even arranged a husband for me when I was 8

But somehow I wasn't like others

At first I fell in love with computers

Mama said that it was the origin of evil

I played games, I browsed Internet, I chatted away with other people

Most of them I didn't know, they were from different places

Then I discovered programming

And it was completely different world for me

I spent all my time reading computer books

And hitting a keyboard

I learned everything about Web, apps, systems

I created many new things - useful and smart

They noticed me and invited for a competition

I met many young people like me

I was lucky to get an award - International

And then Mama told me that time has come to get married

Look after the house, give birth to children

And forget about computers

When my future in-laws visited us to talk about the wedding

I saw my future sister-in-law and fell in love with her

From the first glance. I understood I cannot love a man.

And then it was when my family, my loving family

My Mama and Papa cursed me.

In my country girl cannot love a girl

I learned about a dream country where gender doesn't stop anyone

To love even of same gender

God made us different so why do we have to leave same lives?

I wish to settle in this country

And I have something to offer it

I will get a job and create many small and big things

For the computer to help people to work not so hard and not so much

To feel free and proud

And I will find my love

**Gladys**:

Allow me to introduce our applicant from Zmerbia (not sure we should use
the country).

His name is Slobo Harundjichevski (*or funnier*). Young educated
professional with proven professional experience, excellent sportsman,
happily married. Highly recommended by his Church group, Sports club and
Bank. Clean police record, great family.

Such a candidate would contribute a lot to our economy and with no
doubts soon would become a respectable citizen. Any suburb would dream
to have such a friendly and conscious neighbor. So he is definitely a No
Worries candidate.

**Slobo's and Barb's Song (Ironic)**

v1

Is it a sin to want a wealthy life for your family?

When I was a boy I loved football but wasn't allowed to play

I liked no school nor Church but had to go there

Later I liked girls but where could we go?

I always knew - the boy has to behave!

If you love or like something - you have to behave.

It is hard to match these two verbs - love and behave.

I always was smart - I learned the deal!

If you want to love and behave you need to learn to hide what you love.

Hide your violin when you play football and hide a ball when you come
home

Hide your girl (in bed) when there is nowhere to go.

**Ref - Barb?**

My Slobo is so smart

So clean and so presentable

Role model for the kids

Citizen of the citizens

I love my Slobo and hope he loves me too

Both we will make life in new country

V2

When I grew up I learned about money

That can buy you anything you love - except love of course

I started earning money to get new car and house

However realised that speed was not good fast

It is too hard to make money in the place of my birth

So I checked the Internet and found my new destination

**Ref - Barb?**

In new country you can get a proper job

And get rich in a nick of time!

And then: new car with a sunroof (so romantic)

And then: new house with the garden and automatic gates

And then: shares on the stockmarket

And then: travel with nice hotels to stay

And then: nice dog with pedigree

And then: small yacht

Hey - why small? Yacht better be big!

V3.

Of course we need it big

To sail our children and dog

After the private school and violin lessons

As a reward for good studying and good behavior.

Sitting on a deck with a good cigar and whiskey

Telling of my life and a need to hide my love

**Ali Song (Art puts on a Muslim cap)** *Bitter*

Is it a sin to believe in another god than you?

I live in a country of long history

Where people of different faiths knew each other

Liked each other and respecting each other

Then something changed.

Some people started hating others for them

Praying to different gods.

We are all people, we just want to live in peace.

We want our kids to feel safe and loved.

The were throwing stones into our windows

They humiliated us on the streets

They stopped buying in our stores.

They made the life unbearable.

Most of all I liked when my family met around a table

Shared our favourite dishes cooked with love by my wife

Quietly praying the prayers that our parents taught us.

Talking about small things, laughing and singing.

Now it is all gone.

We ask our children not to tell their friends

What prayers they say for the fear of being beaten at school

It was hard but we still could live

One day my son was kidnapped

We got a letter not demanding a ransom

But with a last warning and demand to leave our country

So that was the last point

We left everything and escaped

We have nowhere to go

We have no place to live

I've heard about new dream country

Where people speak different language

But they agree with other people who believe in different gods

Sing different songs

Eat different food

I wish to live their with my family

Open new store and let everyone buy wonderful fresh produce

Which I know how to find

Where my children would go to school without fear

And then get education and become doctors, lawyers, whatever they choose

And live a better life than me - Is it a sin?

**Vladlen Song**

V1.

Is it a sin to pay good money for the good favour?

I learned long ago that a kind word makes people happy

Flowers would prepare any woman for love

Children love lollies

But most of all everyone loves money

In my country no one was rich but the times came

And everything changed - not for everyone though

Smart people found the ways to make money out of everything

Kiosks grew like mushrooms - to surprise the population

I started selling soft drinks, Rolex watches, - of course fake

Then food and smokes and shoes and knickers

And cheap computers, faxes, stereos, TVs

And then everything else

The time was tough - with gangs and racket and no order or law

Many of my friend were gunned down or disappeared like in Italian movies

But those who survived learned to run business

Favour for a favour or a favour for the money

Want good product - cash to the guard

Want an approval - cash to the clerk

Want a nice girl - cash to the pimp

Nothing good you can get without cash

Life treated me well, I got everything

Nice house to tease (friends)

Nice wife - to please myself

Nice car - feel good

25 accounts in the banks of the world

Kids go to best schools

Soon to go to the best University

But suddenly I realised that plenty of hungry people on the streets

They hate us - "New Zooglians"

But why - everyone had a chance in life?

One day they will jump on us and take us by the throat

Hungry folk does not understand wealthy people

So the time came to move on

And here what I want

Settle in the country where order and law exist

Open the casino

Bring people entertainment - truly they are bored

And new life begins

**Tarek and Hadil Song (**Rock-n-roll theme? Or Sad? Or ballad?**)**

V1.

Is it a sin to like music?

Music is not outside - it is inside of you

How can you choose when it leads you

We have plenty of folk music

It is kind, it is our own, everyone enjoys it

On: Applications

Divide room into class groups

Have audience review others' application

-   One version where we give them the criteria, and one where we invite
    > them to make their own criteria

-   Vague criticism of applications

-   Bureaucracy

    -   Meeting the requirements (prohibition)

    -   Example of TNS' new policies

    -   Phone centre accusing of fraud

    -   Having to leave the country and come back

    -   Getting married pre-maturely as a result of immigration.

    -   Staying with a job that doesn't feed your soul, because of
        > status

-   New Bureaucracy

    -   Based on more arbitrary criteria

    -   To be based on need is subjective

Garry: I always think outside myself, seeing myself as a teacher. In
Manhattenville College, I would meet with students individually, and
learn lots about each individuals' needs, and strengths. I would have to
grade someone based on some "Harvards' Acceptence standards". I would
not do well at grading someone objectively, without considering the
subjective. I would not be good at this job, I would feel the need to
meet with each applicant, and grade them based on all of their
strengths. I would have a hard time grading them based on the specific
grading criteria.

Character idea: Comedic character, who empathizes so much, that no
papers ever get processed. Giving a lot of attention (too much) to each
applicant, interested in everything, and asking lots of questions out of
curiosity.

Writers notes:

Finding the truth of the situation (research).

-   Characters are flaud. If a character that is obvious isn't
    > represented, I'm not satusfied.

Garry: Remembering a situation where, on a jury evaluating requests for
support, the jury ultimately decided that due to the success of the
company to get audiences, the jury decided, the applicant didn't need
the money.

The company incriminated me because I was on the jury that denied the
application. There's something in me that I can identify as a genuine
frustration.

Character: Close to retirement, "I'm not racist, I just think, they can
go somewhere else".

Event idea: Audience is able to go on a journey finding relics that
unveil a life.

> Information about the successes and failures of characters.
>
> Lying on applications as a convention.

Garry: With my German resident status: What is it worth to me to play
the system to go be close with my mom if she needed me. I wouldn't have
it in me to lie in the application. I might go in, and think to lie, but
when I begin the process of following through with my actions, I
couldn't do it.

Agit Prop: Taking a leftist perspective

work.

ROLAND INTERVIEW

It's hard because everything feels like your starting from zero

You're like a baby\...learning to walk...

Adapting to the weather, the language, the culture

Like, in winter you have to know how to make fire

There was one day I walked on the street and I saw a family... a mother
and her children... they're not from here\...you can see it... the
mother is crossing the street at a traffic light and holding her
childrens hands and speaking their language... which makes me feel
"woah\...how do they learn to survive here"\...the mother has to learn
to survive for herself, and on top of that she has to help her children
survive too!\...I can't imagine how hard it is for them

In my experience, the last generation of immigrants spent their entire
life learning how to survive here, they're still working low wage jobs..
Many of them were doctors at home, and now it's 20 years later and they
still can't work in this country in their field. I don't want that to
happen to me

Why using shadow puppets? Because we're talking with our shadow

ROBOT DIALOG

Hello. Welcome to immigration training

Today we will be covering topics such as: reasons for immigration, what
to expect, and questions of identity.

We will be watching some short stories, followed by interviews, then we
will have a game, and finally, something a little more poetic.

Thank you for attending immigration training, and good luck.

There are many reasons why people leave their homes: climate change,
famine, love, financial reasons, social tension, violence, I could go on
for a while.

Please take a moment NOW , to reflect on reasons why you might leave
your home.

Immigration can be a hard process. It can cause distance from your
family and loved ones. Video chat is an option, but it comes with it\'s
own challenges.

We will now review some case studies. Everything you see is based on
lived experiences.

This concludes part 1 of the immigration training program. Please stand
by for part 2: sushi bingo

Thank you for playing sushi bingo.

Part 3 of the immigration training program is a little more abstract,
Poetic.

We will be exploring themes of identity and belonging. Take a moment
now, to reflect on what makes you who you are, and times and places
where you have felt that you belong.

Thank you for completing the immigration training program. Sadly, our
time is up.

Please consider filling out a short anonymous survey. If you would like
to offer more in depth feedback, our staff will be available shortly.

If you would like to donate to the project we will be handing around a
hat. We appreciate any support.

We would also like to thank nova scotia department of communities
culture and heritage for supporting this project.

Please stay seated. We have one final message for you.
