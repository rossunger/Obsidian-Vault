Hey. I know you really like me
And hey, you know I like you too
But the way that you've been acting
It makes me want to spew

Cos I just want to be your friend
And you keep trying to pretend
Like maybe if you just try harder
That I might change my mind

But I don't want that.
I'm sick of being Romance-zoned
If you want something more than friendship
Then maybe I should just go home

I can feel your disappointment,
It's oozing from your eyes
And the pressure of your longing
Makes me paralyzed

I value our friendship
But I'm starting to need space
Cos everytime you come around here
You gaze into my face

And I don't want that.
I'm sick of being Romance-zoned
If you want something more than friendship
Then maybe I should just go home

You've watched too many movies
That taught you how to act
Where the protagonist's relentless
In trying to attract

A friend who doesn't seem to want that
But for some reason they just give in
And the film makes them a happy couple
But that just isn't real
And that's not how I feel

Cos I don't want that.
I'm sick of being Romance-zoned
If you want something more than friendship
Then maybe I should just go home

Yeah I don't want that.
I just wanna be your friend
And maybe you could learn to love that
And maybe that could be the end of the

Romance-zone, Gotta worm my way outta the
Romance-zone, Can't spend another day inside the
Romance-zone, 
The Romance Zone
