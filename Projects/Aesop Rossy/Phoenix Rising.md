I'm furious, fighting the ongoing urge
to demolish the delicate tower, to purge
all the lifelines that failed me before,
I'd take derelict wastelands to feelings of falling some more,
all the spirits so noisy they can't be ignored,
all the movement so nauseous it's shaking my core,
I'm a Phoenix, a Lucifer, burning my sword,
and I'm vanishing, brandishing blemishes stemming from well-wishing relatives relishing parenting overly centering learning and mentoring
Constantly countering counselling, cancelling
Out all the hope and precision, with layers of
doubt, how to cope, and derision,
I never learnt how to make solid decisions
  
I guess I'm learning how to be myself
To open and embody all the parts that many someone's previously ruled were too obnoxious or profound
I guess somehow I let their many voices blister and compound into a
monolithic weight that slowly crushed my spirit into
bonsai boxes
Once I'd locked them I was growing in a space too small 
disfigured wings and shriveled tendons 
sentence me to claustrophobic cramps 
and even now the glass bowl's shattered 
it takes great pains to stretch and seek out all the pieces scattered 

But now I'm grounded in the teachings
and I can trust my bumbling preaching   
yeah, I'm both vociferous and loud
I watch the words fall out my mouth
Before I've had a chance to think them
Blink, and here they are
Delivering the kinda truth bombs 
that I only wish I knew once
But when it's spirit talking you just take the cue 
and follow suit and let the cards play out 
and hope you've got the strength to follow through devoid of dark doubt
