[[Kruslaan]] was a clown. They brought great joy and mirth to many miserable
souls, but like most people these days, they were plagued by an
interminable depression that they were only barely keeping at bay. It
was a constant battle to get up each morning, and if it weren\'t for the
knowledge that their life\'s work was keeping people out of a hopeless
abyss, they probably would have succumbed to the ennui that sat on their
chest like a big black bear.

Kruslaan made their mark on the world by channeling various animals in
their performance. In a time where most children had never seen a
nonhuman living creature, Kruslaan\'s antics were a fantastical concept,
filling people with awe and wonder. The way they moved as if they had
four legs, or like their arms could lift them into the air! What a
sight.

In all honesty, Kruslaan wasn't sure where these images came to them
from. They remembered vaguely having visions as a child and thinking
these were messages from god, but now well into their 50's, it became
difficult not to discount them as mere imaginations. And in some ways,
they were. Imaginations. But on days like today, Kruslaan couldn\'t
shake the feeling of profundity that tagged along with their clowning

The mind may lose track of things, but the body remembers. Across time,
and space, and beyond your lifetime, and your children\'s lifetimes. We
carry all of human history in our cells, we just forgot how to read it.
