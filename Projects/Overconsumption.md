"For white folk, drunk on a frenzy of other people's land and labour, hi
on the things we can make from the earth, then throw out the window for
a dizzying, oil-soaked century now, the scream of the cosmic Canary
broke through the fizz of fast money around the time American
'administrators' and their mates ploughed somewhere around five millions
souls into the soil of Vietnam and her neighbours. But most people
agreed to sacrifice the bird."

> approaches him and invites him to construct a new corporate holiday.
> He thinks it's ridiculous.*

**Council:** Just think about it

**Dad:** Sure

*Dad walks out*

> *Cut to Mum, working on building a self-sufficient Tiny home in an
> attempt to escape society.* Willow is asking lots of questions. She's
> scared they'll have to leave all their friends again. Also, she wants

**Dad:** I'm sorry. I didn't know this booth was taken

**Willow:** You don't have to go. We can share. I'm not a paying
customer so mummy

> says I should take up as little space as possible
>
> *Dad realises how much Willow looks like her mother/him. For a second
> he's paralyzed.*

**Willow:** Do you ever wonder about the straws?

**Dad:** Straws? what about them?

**Willow:** Well, where do they come from? and then where do they all
go? sometimes

> when I watch my mummy cleaning up, I sit on the bench there and look

Lyrics

**[Where do all the straws go]{.underline}**

C Am

Where do all the straws go

Dm7 Gsus7

Where do they go

Dm7 Gsus7 Cma7

Maybe there\'s an island somewhere floating in the sea, Made of plastic
and debris

Dm7 Gsus7

How do they get there?

Dm7 Gsus7

What does it all mean?

Dm7 Gsus7 Cma7

If I don't get some answers I'll scream

So what about me

> I\'m not 3 anymore

I gotta think about the world now

How many straws could there be in that sink?

How could we possibly have so much drink?!

How many islands have we forced upon the sea?

What if there\'s seventy?

What if there\'s more?!

How could there possibly be that much straw!!

Where do all the straws come from?

Where do they go?

*Would you Iike another straw?*

NO!

Girl scouts collecting pledges

**[Pumpkins]{.underline}**

They call me pumpkin headed

everything a growing boy needs

money doesn't grow on trees

grow, my babies feed the world, orange and round and erupt from the
ground

perfectly

plump (favourite color is orange) (pumpkin stew and pumpkin pie)

"so nutritious, \...delicious\...feed the masses, transcend classes"

names for each pumpkin

kissing pumpkins goodnight\...a pumpkin affair

having a favourite pumpkin "but don't tell the others"

having a glass of wine with a pumpkin\...staging fx where we think he's
talking to a person, but then it turns out its a pumpkin

\-\--

Do they know it\'s Xmas
