~~Jules is a male bodied child who wants to play the female lead

casts Jules in that role. When Jules' queer-phobic father, Paul, who is

playing the role, and forces the Quinn to recast Jules in a smaller
role. However, when Jules' replacement falls ill on opening night, Jules
is the only one who can do the part.~~
