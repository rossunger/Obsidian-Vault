Here I am walking down the street
Minding my own business
Then I hear you whistling
"Honey you're so fine"

And I'm feeling kinda angry
Cos I feel objectified
Should I stop and tell you off now, or
Should I just walk by

What if I could really make a difference?
What if I could really change your mind?
(Ha. Good luck)

Catcalling is a crime
Or at least it should be
harassing people passing by
I know that you can do better

I do not exist for you to fantasize
Don't tell me to smile or criticize me
I am not unkind if I avoid your eyes
Don't tell me who I am or try to analyze me
