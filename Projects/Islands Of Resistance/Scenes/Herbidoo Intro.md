[[Herbidoo]] was special. From a young age they had a knack for helping
people. It was their calling. They felt it so deeply in their bones. But becoming any kind of doctor is not in the cards for someone born on the
112th floor, so their parents vigorously tried to stamp out this blossoming dream. It seemed that a lifetime of rejection and disappointment was on the horizon for Herbidoo.

But Herbidoo's gifts transcended education and qualification. They didn't know what they were doing but somehow seemed to make people feel
better just by looking deeply into their eyes and holding their hands.
The more Herbidoo helped people the more their parents worried. That's
how Herbidoo ended up working long shifts at the family bottle shop.
Their parents figured if they were busy working they wouldn't have time
to mess around with futile endeavors. That might have been the case, if
not for a fortuitous visit from the [[Circus]].

The circus was a strange entity. The [[government]] neither supported nor
opposed it, which meant that it was probably doing something illegal
that the government felt was necessary and didn't want to get involved
with. They visited once a year and spent a couple of days exploring the
community, as they did on each floor of the city. One particular day,
Herbidoo was working alone in the [[Apothecary|bottle shop]] when a strange man with a
cougar walked into the store. Herbidoo had never seen an animal like
that before and was instantly obsessed. The strange man looked deeply
into Herbidoo's eyes, and spoke without hesitation

[[JAMAHLEE]]
Would you like to join the circus?

Herbidoo was dumbstruck. Every year, watching the circus folk parading
around town, thinking how lucky they are to meet so many different
people, and to see so many different places, Herbidoo had never dreamed
that of being invited to join them.

HERBIDOO
Me? Why me?

JAHMALEE
Because you have a gift

It wasn't until years later that Herbidoo realised that not everybody
could see [[Jamahlee]]'s cougar. As the mystics in the circus trained them,
it quickly became clear how special Herbidoo really was. The ease with
which they internalised every mystery and healing practice that was
brought to them was unprecedented, and soon word started to spread of
the young prodigy who had joined the circus.

Herbidoo could have been a superstar. With the kinds of magic that they
were bringing into the world, they could have been famous and settled on
one of the upper floors, but through all the razzle daz of circus life
they never forgot their calling. They knew that if they wanted to help
everyone, they would have to stay on the bottom floor.

So here they remained, in the family bottle shop, parents long gone now,
with pilgrims from every floor of the city making the trek down to the
112th floor to see the great mystic healer. It's amazing how far rumours
will travel, and how long they seem to linger. It's a miracle that the
government hadn't come to shut them down yet.

"You can't control your illness, only your reaction to it"

"I've come all this way for you to tell me that you can't help me?"

"That is not what I said"

...

"Your illness puts you in an altered state of mind"

"A gateway to the spirit world"

"There's a lot you can do with that"

...something about caring for the infirm

...something about how being sick being a portal to the spirit world
