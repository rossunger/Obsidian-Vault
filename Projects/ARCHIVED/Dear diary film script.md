Dear diary film script

Dear Diary imagines diary entries from the perspective of everyday
objects such as a kettle experiencing a lot of societal pressure, or a
garbage can who finds that people keep unloading their trash on them.
Inspired by lived experiences of mental health and identity issues, the
film features verbatim voice overs, low-key puppetry, and original
musical underscoring that reflects the emotional abyss of anxiety and
isolation and feeling invisible.


- Dear diary. I've been having a bit of a crisis. I really like helping people and listening to their problems, it\'s really been a core part of my identity, but lately I\'ve been finding myself frustrated, because my friends keep dumping their garbage on me, and nobody\'s stopped to realise that actually, I\'m going through something myself.

    -   Dear diary, I\'m feeling sad. People are saying that I\'m a kill
        > joy, that I suck the life out of anything I touch. I feel so
        > must misunderstood and undervalued. Yeah, I\'m practical and I
        > can\'t help notice the holes in things, but that\'s only
        > because I\'m excited and I want them to succeed. I feel like
        > I\'m on a timer when I\'m with people, like it\'s only a
        > matter of time before they get fed up with me. I just want to
        > find some friends who appreciate my talents.

    -   Dear diary. I\'ve been feeling invisible again. Sometimes I\'ll
        > be talking, and it feels like they\'re looking right through
        > me. Is it because I\'m not exciting enough? I\'m feeling
        > fragile and I just wish I had some people in my life who
        > really like me, and really had capacity to actually see me.

    -   Dear diary, I\'ve been withdrawn lately. Ive been getting a lot
        > of criticism, and as much as I want to change, I just don\'t
        > have capacity for it right now. I\'ve put up my walls and
        > defenses, and really gotta keep those outside voices out, at
        > least for now. I realised that I\'ve been internalizing
        > everything they\'re saying, and it\'s actually harmful.
        > They\'re robbing me of my self respect and self confidence,
        > and sometimes they\'re wrong. I really need to differentiate
        > between trait and state. Sometimes it\'s just a shitty
        > situation and it\'s not my fault.

    -   Dear diary, I want to get better and sharing my true self. I\'ve

        > them like me, but in the long run I feel hollow and alone. I
        > want to try something different, but I lack the tools. Maybe I
        > could start by developing a vocabulary to help me talk about

        > I\'m the only one who even cares. I tried making to do lists,
        > but now they\'re just giving me anxiety. I think part of the
        > problem is that I\'m a workaholic and I don\'t know how to
        > stop. I\'ve been trying to play video games to let off a bit
        > of steam, but it\'s not really working. I just stay analysing

        > realised that romance is the only thing that distracts me from
        > work, but that feels unhealthy for some reason.

    -   Dear diary. I feel so alone. It\'s not even loneliness. Its a

        > limbs and reach out to them, I feel trapped, like someone has
        > dumped slabs of concrete on me. I want to be self sufficient,
        > by also I\'m a social being. I\'m supposed to hold hands with
        > people, literally and metaphorically.

    -   Dear diary, I feel like I\'m losing my grip on reality. I\'ve
        > heard so many sides of the story that I feel nauseous. Im
        > hesitant to trust my memory, but I definitely don\'t trust
        > other peoples memory. Especially as a collective. The human
        > mind is very suggestible. Someone says they saw a thing, and
        > someone else hears it and their mind fills in the blanks, and
        > suddenly two people remember a thing that never happened. At
        > the end of the day, it\'s not about what happened, but what we
        > can do now. How we can make each other feels safer, more
        > validated, supported. Everyone\'s feeling like a victim, and I

-   Fridge

    -   Dear diary, people have been complaining that I\'m cold lately.
        > They know that I have a warm side, but they feel that is
        > inaccessible. I think they\'re right. I want to be warm with
        > people, but I feel so invisible, and there\'s so much going on
        > inside of me that i can\'t figure out how to share with the
        > world. I try to compartmentalize the different issues so that
        > I can deal with them one at a time, but it comes across as
        > robotic. And I don\'t know when it\'s appropriate to talk
        > about anything..I really do much better when things are
        > containered... I like to know that now we\'ll be talking about
        > this thing I\'m going through, and now we\'re don\'t talking
        > about that.

    -   Dear diary. I\'ve been feeling like life is going too fast and
        > maybe I should slow down. It feels like I\'m just going from
        > point A to point B, and not actually enjoying life. I want to

-   Boats

    -   Dear diary. Today there was no sunrise. Only clouds, slowly

        > feels Grey and gloomy. I feel so lost. Like a boat in the
        > middle of an ocean. For a moment I see a glimmer of hope,

        > I\'ll eventually end up somewhere cool. That there is no RIGHT
        > way to do this. But then I\'m on my own again.
