[[Soligar]] had a very simple job. It required extensive technical training,
but on the daily, all they had to do was watch the numbers and make sure

because they were fascinated by plants and hoped that the rainforests of
civilisations past could rise again someday. It definitely wasn\'t
because they were looking forward to sitting in a sterile looking room
with white walls and a digital interface.
