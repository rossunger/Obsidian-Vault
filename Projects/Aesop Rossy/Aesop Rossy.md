IDEAS  






De-fibrillate my fibrous vessels and let the
tessellated Western sediments
re-surge as restless testaments to
how much work is still ahead of us
enormous burnt impediments
descend on us where residents
break bank to live in tenements
where Denizens of venison
In designated garrisons
Accommode unconsciously
Gesticulating warning signs
Foregoing Golden cortisols
For sentimental goings ons
And embryonic pensioners
Accumulate attention spans
Through patented technologies
That are forged in ideologies
Who divisively and Decisively
distort the worlds they pride themselves on
Fermenting their foreign sanctuaries
Tormenting their forlorn actuaries
Perpetuating classroom mortuaries 
Buried in their endless tortured stories 
Burning bridges where they see no glory
Ashes where there should be mores
Destitute, I obsess with you,
over pesticides, in the country side,
where the best us, played the festivals,
where the guests of ours, were intensified,
by the words we said, and the prose we read,
And the harmonies that we cultivated,
And the Vortices that we propagated
All the Pleasantries that we escalated
Delegating 
serenading
Elevating 
promenading
  
Please let this be a time for pastimes 
let it not be crime to cast lines
Desperate seeking fast signs
Praying this to be the last time



My friendships duly dulled by losses 
to restrictive kindship clauses 
caused me catastrophic consequences, 
and citing fatal flaws for sentences 
I found myself contempted, 
says the jury to the arbiter: 
this house is full, it's far fitter 
for this fowl to forfeit furtive fenses 
than expect us lower our defences,
hence, there's nothing left to do 
but send them to the outskirts of our forking friend group,

thus unceremoniously relegated, 
Im abandoned by my delegates
and my Disfunctional disentanglement 
from disingenuous degenerates 
promptly turns a sweet taste sour 
as the power that I abdicate 
leaves a void apt to eradicate 
the foundational sensation 
that bore the burgeoning of my creation, 
all the blood and sweat and tears I tried to 
trade for transcendentalism, 
but the trauma is generational, 
so I fixate on the irrational, 
and I break from the traditional, 
and this phase is just transitional, 



  
Gallivanting salamanders gratifying ex-commanders
Testifying _ glampers
Satisfying 

  
  
  

There's a golden path of balance and I keep tryin'a walk it
But it's hidden from view and it twist and turns without warning
Though you know when you're on it, you can't always see it's directions
With it's higher dimensions, good luck making conscious corrections

I keep following breadcrumbs only to falter and stumble
Then I sit and I wait and I pray for the strength to be humble.
In the stillness of silence I might have a chance still to find it
Then I blink and I sneeze and in a moment of faith I'm inside it
  
Spirits help me find that Golden path
Help me walk in balance and relax
Grant me wisdom clear enough to see it
Grant me patience long enough to be it
Grant me perseverance strong enough to reach it




I'm furious, fighting the ongoing urge
to demolish the delicate tower, to purge
all the lifelines that failed me before,
I'd take derilict wastelands to feelings of falling some more,
all the spirits so noisy they can't be ignored,
all the movement so nauseous it's shaking my core,
I'm a Phoenix, a Lucifer, burning my sword,
and I'm vanishing, brandishing blemishes stemming from well-wishing relatives relishing parenting overly centering learning and mentoring
Constantly countering counselling, cancelling
Out all the hope and precision, with layers of
doubt, how to cope, and derision,
I never learnt how to make solid decisions
  
I guess I'm learning how to be myself
To open and embody all the parts that many someone's previously ruled were too obnoxious or profound
I guess somehow I let their many voices blister and compound into a
monolithic weight that slowly crushed my spirit into
bonsai boxes
Once I'd locked them I was growing in a space too small 
disfigured wings and shrivelled tendons 
sentence me to claustraphobic cramps 
and even now the glass bowl's shattered 
it takes great pains to stretch and seek out all the pieces scattered 

But now I'm grounded in the teachings
and I can trust my bumbling preaching   
yeah, Im both vociferous and loud
I watch the words fall out my mouth
Before I've had a chance to think them
Blink, and here they are
Delivering the kinda truth bombs 
that I only wish I knew once
But when it's spirit talking you just take the cue 
and follow suit and let the cards play out 
and hope you've got the strength to follow through devoid of dark doubt
  


The winds of change are raging,
Staging new beginnings,
Thinning out the weeds of now
that once were cherished dearly for their fruit and flowers,
How do I accept that every season all the islands holding me begin to sink down
Leaving me to flounder till I let myself drown
Escaping to the other side to find a new home
Rake the leaves of friendships with a fine comb
Measure by the pain how much we've all grown
Synchronize our watches and let the time flow
Ride the winds and waves and venture without eyes into the unknown

Watching pretty patterns escalate 
emancipating censored chords 
of censured fjords of feelings that I didn't let my mind know,
tripping up on tangled thoughts that I wouldn't let my mind grow
nipping budding stories lest they manifest all thorny 
into torturous devices
that digest us from inside of us
testing my resolve by peeling heart zest
melting self destructive habbits is the hardest

  
  

Tension and release
A mighty penchant for your dis-ease
Story arcs of suffering find
hearty homes in those who seek peace
Doing as you please,
Constructed like a cryptic crossword in a foreign tongue, deciphering mixed messages
Exhausted from this perfectly preposterous
psuedo-parasitic hyper-analytic never ending
high-stakes friend or long-lost-lover heart and mind trip,
where we're burning, slowly bonding,
turning over past mistakes,
examining absurdly all the unexpected cuts and breaks 
that crept into a crypt of critical but crumbled doorways,
crumpled letters to a younger self lamenting loss of all the lives you could have once lived
Torturing yourself for all the unknown choices that you made while still a wee kid
Recycling old stories with a new twist
Withering away despite a horde of bright gifts
Punishing yourself each time the fading light shifts
Pushing us away until we're trapped in tight slits, into
Gargantuan entanglements
With broken brains and mangled tents
And passengers defenestrating
Sacred things we'd venerated
Can't lock doors with tuck-taped windows
Can't butt horns with rock and splinters
Can't break bread with hostile victims
Can't repair decaying systems
