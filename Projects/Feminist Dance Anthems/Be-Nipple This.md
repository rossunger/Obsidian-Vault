I got breasts, And you've got breasts
And sometimes folks, will call them chests
And often people, are born with nipples
None, One, two, Or sometimes triple

Be-nipple this, Be-nipple that
Be-Riddle me why is showing nipple bad

Big nipple, Small nipple
Short nipple, tall nipple
Nipple's just, A part of me
Like shoulder, ankle, face, Or knee
And all your judgement's, a sexist war
And I won't stand for it no more

Be-nipple this. Be-nipple that
Be-Riddle me why is showing nipple bad

Round nipple, Square nipple
Dressed nipple, bare nipple
I refuse, to be ashamed
And I refuse, to hide away
And I will shout, till I've been heard
Free the nipple, Spread the word

Be-nipple this. Be-nipple that
Be-Riddle me why is showing nipple bad

Straight nipple, Queer nipple,
you don't have to fear nipple
Nipples come, in different sizes,
Colors, shapes, Let's normalise 'em

Pierced nipple, cold nipplie
Tight nipple, old nipple
Drag nipple, star nipple
Milky nipple, scar nipple
