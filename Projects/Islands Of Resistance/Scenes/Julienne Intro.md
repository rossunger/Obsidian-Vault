[[Julienne]] stared blankly out the glass [[elevator]] as it ascended out of the shadows. They had long since accepted their place in the world. They were very lucky - luckier than most. As a housekeeper for the elite, they got enough sunlight to keep them alive without having to scramble into the crowded [[Sunbanks]] everyday. Julienne could only imagine that kind of poverty. They had heard stories of people clawing each other's eyes out just to be at the head of the line for 4:15 when the rays hit [[greenhouses]]. Apparently down at ground level there was only 1 minute a day. What can you do with 1 minute of Sun? 

As the elevator passed the threshold, Julienne closed their eyes. They felt their skin breathe a sigh of relief as the life flooded back into their body. Thank God it's Monday, they thought. After a weekend of no Sun, Monday mornings were brutal, but as soon as that Sun hits your face, it's like you're a whole new human. Julienne didn't believe in Gods or prayers, but old  habits die hard, so they mumbled a few muted words. 

The elevator stopped at floor number 23. Some gentlefolk with a pram stepped happlessly onto the platform. They had a soft glow to them, but still they seemed miserable. Didn’t they realise how lucky they are? On the 23rd floor you could have enough sun to not have to think about it. Not enough to make any real impact on the world, but you weren’t worrying about where your next meal’s coming from.

As the elevator ascended further, Julienne tried not to eavesdrop on the whispering couple, but it quickly proved impossible. “[[Jerrod]], we’re not going over this again. We visit your parents once a week and that’s IT. I don’t want them influencing our child any more than they already do.” “But they make a good point. If we keep her segregated like this she’ll grow up to be an asshole.” “Don’t talk about my daughter like that!” “She’s our daughter” 

Julienne was relieved when the pram and it’s bickering attendants made their exit at floor 15. Julienne often dreamed about what it would be like to be well off. First order of business would be a nice sunbathe, and then helping friends and family. They wondered how they would decide where to draw the line. After all, you can’t help everyone. 

At floor 13 a hung-over hoard stumbled rudely in and mashed all the buttons. After they fell out at floor 12 Julienne noticed a strip of [[sunpatches]] that they’d left behind. A couple of them seemed like they might still have half a charge left in them. How wasteful. Julienne pocketed the strips and tapped the door close button. Down on 123rd floor these patched would sell like hotcakes. The government considered them a luxury item even though they were essential to life for the bottom dwellers. Julienne had read that earlier in the 21st century there had been a luxury tax on crucial hygiene products and that the people had revolted. Julienne wasn’t sure why, but they could feel a palpable hatred for the [[government]]. Was it an ingrained sense of identity that came with years of living in the dark?

At floor 11 a sobbing youth charged into the elevator and collapsed in the corner drowning in tears. “What floor are you going to?” “I don’t care” “They’ll arrest you if you try to-” “I don’t care!” “Are you ok?” “NO!” As Julienne tried to comfort her she noticed a bulging rhinoceros charging for the door. A flurry of suitcases and loose clothing hit Julienne in the face followed by a roar “And don’t come back”

  

  

Julienne got off at floor number 3.
