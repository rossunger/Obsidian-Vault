[[Laroo]] was an opportunist. A few years ago they had happened upon an
antique piece of Sun tech going for a pittance and having acquired it
they proceeded to open a business just below the blackout line offering
illegal sun treatments masquerading as a beauty clinic. Laroo's
[[Solarium]] they called it. To the untrained eye Laroo might seem like an
activist fighting against the system, offering a much needed public
service, however Laroo's motivations were purely financial.

For an average week's salary, a lower-middle class citizen could
receive a makeover and an hour of low quality artificial Sun.
