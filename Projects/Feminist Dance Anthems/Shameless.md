#### Shameless
*(Lyrics by Micci aka Micaela Comeau)
A song about being comfortable in your own skin, and shedding societal
expectations*

Film clip of people eating fruit
Bring pitch down by 4
Base in love,
bend my cuicuits baby,
berghain,
berimbowwow base 1,
binary bubbles,
Casiobouncer,
Chase the flute,
Chest press wobble,
childnishness,
cinque cento,
coffee can arp,
colours of light,

Shameless, is what I want to be
Shameless so you can see me
Shameless in my own skin
I don't want to try to blend in

Shameless, want to hear my own voice
Shameless, want to live my choice
Shameless, want to sing out my pride
Don't want to try to hide

You head to toe me then you ask what's the occasion,
why you look so fine?
Then I say, thanks, - - I felt hot today
so I thought I'd show off a bit of waist
You look a bit shocked, a little bit surprised,
you say wow, never heard a girl say that before,
Why so much confidence?
I say why not you know I'm shameless
it's something that we're all meant to be
And hell yes I do look fine don't you agree,
Well\.... yes, you say, you look great,
it's just, now I'm left with nothing else to say \...
Oh I see, I'm sorry, I forgot,
I was supposed to put myself down so that you could build me up,
Pat me on the head and slap me on the ass,
Tell me that you think I'm cute and then you make a pass
I forgot that is what I should say if I wanna be perceived be
well-behaved
But I tell you what, I'm not waiting to be saved

Shameless, is what I want to be
Shameless so you can see me
Shameless in my own skin
I don't want to try to blend in

Shameless, want to hear my own voice
Shameless, want to live my choice
Shameless, want to sing out my pride
Don't want to try to hide

I forget I should be honoured, that I caught your eye,
even though Society dictates that I should swoon and sigh
But you're not my validation, not my rhythm or my beat,
You can't buy me with a drink you know I'm not that cheep,
You think that raising an eyebrow and saying that I impressed you,
Is enough to make me want to jump into bed and have sex with you,
I'm tired of your predictions, your expectations and your ways,
This is from a woman who is rarely well behaved,

Shameless, is what I want to be
Shameless so you can see me
Shameless in my own skin
I don't want to try to blend in

Shameless, want to hear my own voice
Shameless, want to live my choice
Shameless, want to sing out my pride
Don't want to try to hide

Don't think that you'll lure me in with your talk of income and your
wage,
You cannot buy me, and I don't care how well you're paid,
So if I'm feeling like I'm wanting some companionship,
Don't think I'll come to you, don't be ridickulous.
I wear my heart out on my sleeve and I'm an easy book to read
But don't think that that means I am easily deceived
It just means that the feelings that I'm feeling you can see
And I wear them on my skin, I wear them on my skin, I wear them on my
skin\...
Shamelessly

Shameless, is what I want to be
Shameless so you can see me
Shameless in my own skin
I don't want to try to blend in

Shameless, want to hear my own voice
Shameless, want to live my choice
Shameless, want to sing out my pride
Don't want to try to hide
