CONCEPT

A “museum” guide gives neighbours a tour of our house and our lives. We play out verbatim scenes of what it’s like to live here, and some of the challenges that come with not knowing our neighbours. Part of the tour is that the museum guide share vulnerable things about us and our lives, which gives audiences a chance to know us deeply, and is an invitation for them to be vulnerable in the future. This creates a framework for vulnerability, connection, and belonging in your neighbourhood. 

Part of the project is that we will create guidelines for other to recreate this project in their house and invite their neighbours to witness their lives and vulnerability.
