## I can feel my body - a book about Meditation (draft 3)

Sometimes when life gets busy, I get stuck in my head and I forget to feel my body.
But my body is important. It tells me all sorts of things.

It tells me when I’m happy
It tells me when I’m tired
It tells me when I’m lonely
It tells me when I’m angry

Sometimes when I’m stuck in my head I don’t know what I’m feeling. 
But then I remember there’s something that can help!
Meditation!

Meditation comes in many forms and means different things to different people. 
To me it means reconnecting with my body.

I start by noticing my breath; how it feels in my nose; how it feels in my lungs. 
Then I listen for my heartbeat. Did you know that you can feel your heartbeat all over your body?

I feel it in my chest. 
I feel it in my fingers. 
I feel it in my toes. 
Where can you feel your heartbeat?

Now I try to feel my whole body all at once. 
Sometimes it’s tingling. 
Sometimes it’s still. 
Sometimes I’m not quite sure, so I ask my body “how are you feeling today? Is there anything you need?

And then I listen.
Sometimes it takes a little while, but if you’re very quiet, and you listen very hard, eventually you’ll hear it tell you.

I love my body. 
Sometimes it’s easy to hear it. 
Sometimes it’s very hard. 
Sometimes life gets in the way. 
All I know is, the more I listen, the easier it gets.

## Sometimes I… - a book about neurodiversity (draft 3)

Everybody’s brain works differently. My brain works like this:

Sometimes I think quickly
Sometimes I think slowly
Sometimes I can’t think at all

Sometimes I notice sounds
Sometimes I notice images
Sometimes I’m just daydreaming in my head. 

Sometimes I like to focus on many things at once
Sometimes I like to focus on just one thing
Sometimes I can’t focus at all  

Sometimes I like to be around people
Sometimes I like to be alone
Sometimes I just don’t know what I want

Sometimes I’m good with number. 
Sometimes I’m good with words
Sometimes I feel like I’m not very good at anything

Sometimes I understand
Sometimes I don’t
Sometimes I think I get it, but it’s actually all wrong

Sometimes I can manage on my own
Sometimes I need help
Sometimes I need to try it first and fail, and then I’ll ask for help

Sometimes I want your advice
Sometimes I just want you to listen
Sometimes I’m just talking to myself

Sometimes I feel like I belong
Sometimes I feel I’m different
Sometimes I’m too busy trying to figure out what’s going on.

Everybody’s brain works differently. My brain works like this.

## I’m Not Ready Yet - A book about trust (draft 2)

Lucy wants to be best friends. I don’t know how I feel about it yet.
“Lucy, I really like you, but I’d like to spend more time getting to know you before we’re best friends."
“That’s ok. Can I still come over after school?”
“yeah!”

Rojo wants to trade lunches. I really like cheese sandwiches, but something doesn’t feel right.
“Rojo, I like cheese sandwiches, but I’m not ready to trade yet. Maybe ask me some other time”
“Ok. Do you still wanna play?”
“Yeah!”

“Ms Jenkins, why won’t Guma let me braid their hair?”
“That’s because Guma loves their hair, and doesn’t know what you might do with it”
“But I told them I was gonna braid it”

“Guma doesn’t know you very well, and sometimes words mean different things to different people. Sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes people hurt each other. Guma’s not ready to trust you with braiding their hair. Do you know what trust is?

No  

Trust means different things to different people. To me, trust means knowing what to expect from someone. It takes a long time to build trust. Guma’s still developing trust with you. That’s ok. 

Ms Jenkins, can I braid your hair?
Sure. But be gentle!


## I don’t want that - a book about Boundaries (draft 1)

Bibi says I should give grandma a kiss, but I don’t want that. 
“Grandma, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you, I just don’t want that”
“Looks like Grandma’s sad. Is that my fault?”
“No, honey. Grandma’s just processing what happened” 

Mimi says that I should eat my peas, but I don’t want that.
“Mimi, I don’t like peas. They don’t make me feel good”
“Honey, you have to eat your vegetables”
“I know you just want the best for me, but I really don’t want the peas. Maybe I can eat the carrots instead? 

Nini says that I should watch my language! But I don’t want that
“Sometimes I like to swear because it helps me to express how I’m feeling”
“But if you swear you’re going to offend some people and they won’t want to be your friend”
“That sound really judgemental of them. Changing the way I speak to please others is manipulative and oppressive, and I don’t want that”. 

Didi says that I have to play with them, but I don’t want that
“Didi, I don’t want to play with you right now. It doesn’t feel good”
“Didi’s angry. Is it my fault?”
“No. Didi’s got her own stuff to deal with“
“Didi, why does this upset you?”
“Because I wanted to play”
“But do you want that even if it makes me unhappy?”
“I guess not. Do you not like me anymore?”
“I like you! I just don’t want to play right now. But maybe later?”

I want Kiki to drive me to the pool, but they don’t want that.
If I cry and scream they’ll probably take me, but that would be controlling.
It’s not nice to control people. Maybe I can meet my own needs. 
I’ll go and have a bath instead.


## I want, I need!

Baba, I miss you. I want to see you today. 
Baba, I'm tired. I can't listen to you anymore. I want to have a nap. I NEED to have a nap
Baba, I'm scared. I can't do this on my own. I want your help. I NEED your help
Baba, I'm feeling angry. I want you to give me some space. I need you to give me some space so I can process my emotions  
Baba, I'm hungry. I want you to get me some food. I can't do it myself, so I NEED you to get me some food
Baba, im feeling small. I want you to stand up for me. I NEED you to stand up for me
  

INITIAL CONCEPTS  

## Talking to your parts
   
Sometimes when I don’t understand what I’m feeling, I talk to my parts.
 
There’s the part that makes decisions. 
There’s the part that feels all the emotions
There’s the part that wants things
There’s the part that’s like a security guard, telling me who I can trust, and when things are safe.
There's the part of me that feels embarrassed when I make mistakes
There's the part of that feels like I'm not good enough.

Blue’s Best Performance

By Sahara May

  

My name is Blue and I’m an actress.  I sing and I dance, and I love to dress up in all sorts of clothes and costumes and prance around on stage.  Acting is my favourite thing in the whole wide world.

  

I’ve played a pirate, a penguin, a princess, and a peach.  And I do my best in every role I’m in.

****

Mr. Katz says that if I stick with it, I might even act on TV one day!  Or on Broadway, which would be a dream come true.

  

Nana says that she used to be an actress when she was young like me.  

When I grow up, I definitely want to be famous.

****

Last week, our class put on a Little Red Riding Hood show for the whole school and I played the Big Bad Wolf!  As always, I wanted to play the lead, but the wolf is a good character too, so I didn’t mind too much.

  

Julia got to play the main role of Red Riding Hood.  I was a bit jealous at first, but it didn’t last long.

****

Julia and I are best friends.  We met last year when we ended up in the same class together.  Now we hang out sometimes after school and walk to the store to get ice cream.  

  

Or she’ll come over to my house and we’ll jump on the trampoline.  Or we’ll play dress-up.  Or we’ll do both!

****

Julia came over to my house almost every day last week to practice for the show.  We’d read our lines together and then perform them for my mom in the kitchen.  It was a ton of fun!  

  

I really like Julia.  Sometimes I get a little nervous or excited when I know she’s going to come over.  My mom says I might have a crush.  

****

She says it’s not unusual for kids (and adults) to have crushes and that I don’t need to be afraid of my feelings because they’re normal.

  

She says that Julia is a nice girl and a good friend.  I think so too.

****

The night of the play, Mr.Katz wished us all good luck.  We put on our costumes and gave each other all high-fives before going back stage.  

  

We could hear the audience outside clapping; all our parents and siblings and classmates were out there in the crowd.

****

Everyone performed their very best.  The crowd laughed when
