You've been fighting oh so hard for oh so long it seams
Standing up for our water, and the land and all our dreams
Always looking out for what is needed in the moment
Never giving up on all the things that are important
You must be exhausted always beaten down by corporations
Maybe now It's time to take a break

Let's take a moment to enjoy your life, get outta your head
Cos what's the point of all this struggle if you're drowning in dread
We gotta take the time to be with spirit, make sure she's fed
So let's go out and smell the roses before they're all dead
Smell the trees, the air, while they're still there

Waking up each morning to more News of something dreadful Passing
Working overtime to guarantee a brighter future for our kids
You're looking out for what is needed in each moment
Never giving up on all the things that are important
You must be exhausted always between down by corporations
Maybe now it's time to take a break

Let's take a moment to enjoy your life, get outta your head
Cos what's the point of all this struggle if you're drowning in dread
We gotta take the time to be with spirit, make sure she's fed\\
So let's go out and smell the roses before they're all dead
Smell the trees, the air, while they're still there
