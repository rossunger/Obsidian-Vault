[[Jiyergilai]] liked to imagine possibilities. As they sat in the waiting
room, they imagined what would have happened if they had sat next to the
sweet looking older lady in the corner. Maybe they would have started
talking. Maybe they would've become best friends. Maybe they would've
discovered that she was a plant specialist, and maybe she would invite
Jiyergilai to her [[greenhouse]] on the seventh floor, and they could
finally see a real life tree. What a dream!

Jiyergilai had hoped to work with trees every since they first heard
about them, but quickly realised that it is an expensive field to get
into, and despite coming from the 36th floor, Jiyergilai encountered
some serious gatekeeping at every turn. It was discouraging for sure,
but Jiyergilai was creative, and resilient, and that's how they found
themselves sitting in a tiny waiting room at the [[department of pest control]].
